 swedish_gustavianDESCR:0 "In the early 17th century the musket had a loading time that was still very slow and musket fire needed to be concentrated in volleys to be destructive, as the weapons were very inaccurate and misfires were common. Such a slow reloading time meant that the unit would be very vulnerable if all the guns were fired simultaneously. Since the days of Maurice of Nassau this problem was overcome by arranging the unit in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. Gustavus Adolphus, the great Swedish king, significantly improved this Maurician infantry tactic. He trained his troops so well that he was able to reduce the number of ranks to only three (one kneeling, the second crouching and, the third standing) and yet still maintain continuous fire."

In the 17th century, cavalry forces were still used for a surprise effect in battles, but had often little chance against disciplined pikemen. Therefore, cavalry forces were little used in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe with its vast steppes, cavalry remained very important. The winged Hussars played a key role there. The Polish developed an excellent curved saber (the 'palasz'), selected horses specially for their speed and endurance and they carried lances with them, of six meters, that could pierce a pikemen's armor. The winged Hussars became a heavily armored cavalry that fought countless victorious actions against a variety of enemies. They played a key role in John Sobieski's legendary lifting of the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. John Sobieski sent four Hussar cavalry groups in a furious charge that broke the Turkish battle line, scattering them in confusion. This victory by the winged Polish Hussars saw John Sobieski hailed as the 'savior of Vienna'."

Tercio formations, with their disciplined and spirited professional soldiers, were famed on the European battlefield for their nearly invincible manner in combat during the 16th and 17th centuries. Their domination of the European battlefields came to a definite end with the Spanish defeat by the French at the battle of Rocroi in 1643. A new fighting system, promoted by Gustavus Adolphus, would take over from then on."

The pieces were set for yet another grand European war, not only fought on the European mainland, but also on the world seas and in North America. Historically, the war ended with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, where Philip was indeed recognized as Spanish king after he had renounced his claims in the French line of succession."

Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."

They consisted of commoners and the lower class nobles, and were the mainstay of the ruler's army. At first, the foot soldiers were only mercenaries and adventurers, and were paid with looted goods but later on they became a core part of the local lord's army. As battles, wars and the larger size of armies became more complex, they were vigorously trained so they could hold their ground against the oncoming enemy forces. Foot soldiers were mostly armed with spears but some did carry swords/katanas and others were used to operate war machinery, as well as being equipped with varying bows. Foot soldiers generally had light armor, consisting of leather pads sown together or a mixture between leather and iron/copper armors. This made them more agile on the battlefield but at times vulnerable against their opponents. In later periods foot soldiers were given firearms as well."

Scottish Highlanders were lightly armored clansmen, often equipped with the traditional Scottish basket-hilted sword, the claymore, as well as small knives, known as dirks. Later Highland soldiers also carried pistols. They were feared for the ferocity of their attack, particularly the famous Highland Charge, used to smash through enemy lines. Following the Jacobite rebellions, the Scottish Highlanders were gradually assimilated into the British Army. The first such Highland troops were the Black Watch, or 42nd Highland Regiment of Foot, who fought valiantly at Fontenoy during the War of Austrian Succession. The Highland Regiments subsequently became a feared fighting force, noted in particular for bravery and a refusal to surrender."

 leather_cannonDESCR:0 "The Leather Cannon was first used by the armies of King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden during the third Polish-Swedish War. European artillery at this time was too large and heavy to be mobile on a battlefield, and was only really used during sieges. The introduction of a lighter, mobile cannon enabled the Swedes to maneuver their artillery to meet the movements of the enemy and gave them a distinct tactical advantage over their foes. Unfortunately the leather cannon used by the Swedes had a particular weakness which made it highly impractical. Consisting of a narrow copper tube covered in leather strapping and rope, its wrapping caused the cannon to overheat dangerously during continuous use. Nevertheless the Leather Cannon marked the beginning of the development of light field artillery and the concept of taking heavy firepower to the enemy."

Army tacticians typically deployed musket-men in formations to maximize firepower. The muskets would thus be arranged in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. This maximized the firepower of the 16th century muskets and overcame their disadvantage of slow reloading. It was Maurice of Nassau who pioneered the use of these musket formations and taught it to Dutch troops in the Eighty Years' War. His development of military strategy and tactics made the Dutch army the most modern in Europe."

Like many Gaelic warriors before them, the galloglaigh used the two-handed battle-axe, but were also well-armored in the Norse style with chain mail and helmets. They appeared in Ireland from the mid thirteenth century and soon became highly sought-after warriors in the service of the great Irish chiefs, right through to the sixteenth century. The Galloglaigh fought alongside their retainers in what was known as a 'spar', consisting of the warrior, his kern (a gaelic squire armed with pike or javelin) and his horse-boy (armed with a shortbow or a sheaf of darts). Collectively these spars would group in war-bands, or Corrughadh, which could number over a hundred strong. The galloglaigh were feared by the English as, whilst no match for a heavy medieval army in the open field, they proved a deadly force in small, close confrontations. As a result they were often used by Irish lords as shock troops in ambush situations. These Hebridean warriors did also find success on the open battlefield, most notably at Bannockburn in 1314."

Condotta were not very loyal to their employers often switching sides because of higher pay. When Condotta fought each other they also made deals to not harm each other too much and war in Italy often became a sort of theater. Condotta regiments consisted of armored knights and heavy and light infantry and crossbowmen. The Condotta had a monopoly on warfare in Italy which meant that they still used old weapons and tactics when the other European armies already had switched to infantry consisting of musketeers and pikemen."

In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units from the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The loose order of infantry was revolutionary on the European battlefield. However there were those that totally rejected the skirmisher concept and went for rigid linear tactics. Christened Square Infantry due to the formation they assumed when defending against cavalry. These were tightly disciplined units trained to fire their muskets at a high rate and fire by platoon which meant that rather than use the single volley and reload style during combat, these units would always have a platoon discharging their muskets. The deadly ripple fire could break any assault. However, rigid linear tactics made these units less mobile and more defensive."
