Thinking it would be more difficult to carry out a Bourbon restoration if the Bonaparte succession was secured in the constitution, Napoleon decided to re-create the hereditary monarchy in France and had himself crowned emperor by Pope Pius VII on 2 December 1804 at Notre-Dame."
 flavor_fra.EVTDESC100:0 "The 'Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise' was an assassination attempt on the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of France, in Paris on 24 December 1800. The attempt was carried out by seven royalists who had connections to the earlier Chouan Revolt. A bomb hidden in a barrel loaded on a parked cart exploded just as Napoleon and his escort were passing by on the way to the Opéra to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' The bomb, nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse. The explosion killed several bystanders but failed to hurt Napoleon."
