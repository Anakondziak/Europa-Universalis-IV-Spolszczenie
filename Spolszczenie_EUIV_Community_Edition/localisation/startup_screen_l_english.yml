A bitter feud for the throne between the rival brothers Tayatzin and Maxtla left them vulnerable, and in 1428 they were overthrown by the nascent alliance between the city-states of §YMexico-Tenochtilan§!, §YTlacopan§! and §YTexcoco§!. Having now consolidated their power, this §YAztec§! triple alliance led by §YMontezuma Ilhuicamina§! now look to expand beyond their homes, in particular toward the wealth of the §YMixtec§! cities (such as §YCoixtlahuaca§!) to the south.\n\nEast of the Aztec, the allied city-states of §YTlaxcala§! are determined to maintain their independence in the face of Aztec aggression. The Aztecs are willing to accept it: Tlaxcalan captives taken in war to offer as sacrifice have far greater value to the empire than Tlaxcalan subjects. Meanwhile, to the south, the Nahuatl people of §YTeotitlan§! play the dangerous game of trying to maintain their independence through friendship with the Empire, rather than through warfare.\n\nTo the west, in the highlands of §YMichoacan§!, the cities of Lake Patzcuaro were unified between 1300 and 1350 under the rule of §YTariacuri of Tzintzuntzan§!. From this power, Tariacuri's §YTarascan§! successors have spread further, creating a powerful state that can rival the Aztecs. Between them both Tarascans and Aztecs eye the §YMatlatzinca§! of the valley of §YTolluca§! warily: while they would make a nice addition to either empire, they may be more valuable as a buffer state, and aggression in that direction may well draw the two powers in a war they do not wish to fight.\n\nBut Tolluca is not the only worry of the Tarascan rulers. To the west and north of their realm, a plethora of small states like §YColima§!, §YTonalla§! and §YXalixco§! watch over wealthy saltpeter deposits that the Tarascans would like to control. Independently, they are unlikely to resist Tarascan expansion, but if they were to assist one another, they could be a formidable obstacle to Tarascan expansion.\n\nFinally, at the northern edge of the region, the various people that the Aztec collectively call §YChichimeca§! are a perennial source of problem for the more settled states to the south.

In its stead only one last §YMayan§! empire remained to hold the Yucatan together: the §YLeague of Mayapan§!. In 1441, however, the §YXiu§! rulers of §YUxmal§! broke free of the League, slaughtering the entire §YCocomes§! ruling family of Mayapan, save for one survivor. Returning to Yucatan, that survivor rallied his allies, and founded a new capital at §YSotuta§!, while the Xiu moved theirs to Mani. With their bitter rivalry, the last ties holding Yucatan together have fallen apart, and other polities, like §YChactemal§! and §YCan Pech§! are striking out on their own, rejecting the influence of the great dynasties of ancient Yucatan.\n\nFurther south, in the mountains of §YGuatemala§!, little is left of the once-great cities in the region.

Much of the Kiche's power rests on their alliance with their powerful vassals, the §YKaqchikel§!. So long as they stand together, they are powerful, but should event divide them, let alone turn on each other, the Kiche's power would be greatly diminished. Nearby, the §YCh'orti§! people, the heirs to the once-great city of §YCopan§!, largely stay out of the politics of their neighbors, while in the mountain valleys of §YChiapas§!, a plethora of local Mayan people, like the §YTzotzil§!, remain largely ignored by the more powerful realms around them. North of the Chiapas, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the last descendants of the §YOlmec§! people, the §YYokot'an§!, likewise keep to their land, though they maintain a brisk trade with their neighbors.\n\nBut not all Mayan people live in the regions surrounding the Yucatan. Far to the north, beyond the lands of the Nahuatl people, the §YHuastec§! people left Mayan country thousands of years ago, driven north by the pressure of the then-nascent, now-forgotten Olmec Empire.

Its monarchs were eager participants in the Reconquista, the campaign of conquest against the Muslim states of §YIberia§!, which saw Aragon expand to its current southerly extent and add the Kingdom of §YValencia§! to the composite Crown.\n\nThe fates of Aragon and Navarra are once again tied together; the King of Navarra is also the heir to the Aragonese throne. Should §YKing Joan§! manage to survive his father §YAlfons V§! while preserving the independence of Navarra, the two nations will be joined in a personal union under one monarch.\n\nOn the subject of dynastic unions, the Kingdom of §YNaples§! in southern Italy is also subject to the Crown of Aragon. Aragon rules §YSicily§! directly, but Naples has yet to be fully integrated into the Crown following King Afonso’s conquest of the kingdom in 1442. The former King of Naples, §YRené of Anjou§!, has fled to §YProvence§! where he continues to insist upon his claim not only on Naples but also on Aragon itself as well as §YJerusalem§!.\n\nAragon’s relationship with its powerful neighbour §YCastile§! is difficult to pin down. Though these nations share a dynasty, the feuding House of §YTrastámara§! is rarely at peace with itself. At times it seems as though peace may be possible and that the two Crowns could be united into one, while at other times it seems that the kingdoms are destined to struggle against one another for eternity as bitter rivals.\n\nBeyond dynastic matters, Aragon is a nation deeply concerned with dominating trade in the Mediterranean. Aragon’s §YConsulate of the Sea§! aims to regulate and administrate all trade in the region, while Catalan and Valencian merchants struggle against merchants from §YGenoa§! and §YTuscany§! to control the flow of profit. Aragon also has designs upon the elusive §Ysilk§! trade. Silk has traditionally seen almost no production in Europe; its secrets are closely guarded but now seem to be within reach."

With the ascendence of the §YHohenzollern§! Dynasty things have slowly begun to change. Friedrich I spent his entire reign wearing down the influence of the Brandenburg estates and fighting the prevalent lawlessness, sending his armies against the castles of the many robber barons that have for long had a free reign over the region.\n\nIn many ways §YFriedrich II§!, 'the Iron', has proven to be his father's son, resuming the policies intended to crush the power of local potentates and greedy burghers. He has also sent out feelers to the §YTeutonic Order§! for the reclamation of §YNeumark§!, a land originally part of Brandenburg, but pawned by his predecessors.\n\nThe difficulty in asserting state power is amply demonstrated by the Kalmar Union kingdoms of §YDenmark§!, §YSweden§! and §YNorway§!, were a king attempting to achieve similar goals was recently deposed and replaced by a Bavarian Wittelsbach. If Brandenburg is to be made a durable state it must also remain united, avoiding squabbles like those among the §YWettin§! heirs in Electoral §YSaxony§! to the south.\n\nThe nearby kingdoms of §YPoland§! and §YBohemia§! are both without rulers in 1444, one as a direct result of the failed Crusade of Varna against the Ottomans, and the other due to the rejection of the Habsburg heir Ladislaus the Posthumous by the Bohemian nobility.

Nowhere are the knightly ideals of the late middle ages as alive as in Burgundy, with great tournaments, grand feasts, and of course the Order of the Golden Fleece itself. A knightly order created by the Duke, aspiring to recreate the knighthood of the Arthurian legends or Greek myths. The Burgundian court also dominates fashion and art, with fortunes being spent on silk, paintings and fantastic illuminated manuscripts.\n\nThe Duchy of Burgundy already rival many kingdoms in influence, income and even military might. By playing off the English and French against each other the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time.

Such feuds might well cripple the internal stability of the Kingdom, especially if hostilities in France commence again.\n\nWith the English busy with continental and internal affairs the dominion over §YIreland§! has shrunken to a thin strip along the sea known as 'The Pale', with Gaelic lords as well as Hiberno-Normans acting entirely independent of the English Crown.

These are the famous §YJanissaries§!, who will in time grow into a powerful standing army. The Ottomans have come to power with the military backing of numerous marcher-lords, still highly autonomous on the Balkan frontier, while the administration lies in the hands of the Turkish aristocracy, literate in the ways of statecraft, but largely independent of the sultan's authority.\n\nAll this is about to change. Having defeated the Crusader armies, the old sultan Murad II is now on his way back to his estates in Manisa, leaving the government in the hands of the young §YMehmed II§!. It is he who will go on to transform the Ottoman state into an empire, acquiring Constantinople as an imperial capital and establishing a centralized administration to rein in the marcher-lords and old Turkish families.

As Afonso grows older however other forces at court will try to control him, hoping to use the young king for their own designs.\n\nWhile Castile has had a series of weak rulers and strong nobles, the Castilians can be a serious threat to the Portuguese.

In the north Mamluk influence is felt from the beyliks of Anatolia to the shores of Lake Van. In the south they serve as protector of the Holy Cities of §YMecca§! and §YMedina§! in the §YHejaz§! as well as influencing the politics of §YYemen§!. Even the Christian empire of §YEthiopia§! must be attentive to the word of the Mamluk Sultan, as the Coptic pope, the ordainer of all Ethiopian bishops, is under Mamluk care.\n\nThe Mamluk amirs reproduce their ranks by purchasing new mamluks, foreign slaves mostly of Circassian origin. These slaves are then trained as soldiers or stewards, who all swear allegiance to their buyer, or 'foster-father'. The amirs in turn put their household to use in the service of the sultans. When the time for succession comes it is in practice the will of these powerful men that determines which amir will become the next sultan. This system ensures that the sultanate is never short of elite warriors, so long as the route to import more slaves from the Black Sea lies open. However, as a governing system it has more than once lead to damaging conflicts and paralyzing factionalism.\n\nThe future looks bright for the Mamluk Sultanate however, as the death of Timur has removed the greatest threat in the region, with the once expansive §YTimurid§! Empire now reduced to a few bickering successor states in §YPersia§! and §YTransoxiana§!. The vacuum left by this empire in Anatolia, the Caucasus and Iraq has been filled by the §YQara Qoyunlu§!

Both seem destined to come into conflict with the Mamluks in the near future.\n\nThe wealth of the sultanate is fed by the trade that flows through its Egyptian lands, bridging the distance between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This places great demands on the Mamluk fleets to battle Christian pirates in the north as well as to protect the huge vulnerable vessels that follow the Hejaz coastline with coffee, cloth and spices through the Red Sea.\n\nAs [GetYear] draws to an end the Mamluk Sultanate is still the largest, richest and strongest state in the Middle East, it has many enemies but fears few of them."

While the Grand Principality of Muscovy is not the oldest of these states it has recently grown to be the strongest. Located in the relatively fertile Opolye, Muscovy has a stronger internal economy than many other principalities. More importantly their princes have often acted as collectors for the Khans of the Golden Hordes.

The core of their empire, the §YGreat Horde§! is still a strong power in its own right, but it is fraught by internal struggles and has been unable to project much power over the Russians.\n\nMuscovy has made good use of this power vacuum, expanding their control over the other principalities rapidly, through both cunning and use of military resources. Often even by simply buying out the poorer Princes and adding their lands to the Muscovite domain.\n\nMoscow is not the only strong state with interest in the Russian region, however, in the north the Republic of §YNovgorod§! has colonized much of the White Sea coastline, securing the valuable waterways and a source of fur, the soft gold of the north and east.\n\nTo the west the Grand Duchy of §YLithuania§! and the Kingdom of §YPoland§! are doing what they can to assume the leadership of all Russias, asserting authority over most Ruthenian lands as well as a constant factor in the politics of the free Russian states in the north.

Jaunpur controls a vast stretch of the Doab, the great riverine lands of the Ganges. Bengal and Jaunpur came to blows as recently as 1420. Though the conflict came to an abrupt end due to the intervention of Timurid and Ming envoys, many sore issues remain between both nations and further wars may be inevitable.\n\nRelations with the Buddhist Sultans of §YArakan§! have fluctuated wildly; in one year they are the Bengal’s loyal subjects, in another they are ambivalent allies, and in yet another they are a pirate menace. Future relations with Arakan are likely to be guided just as much by circumstance.\n\nBengal is a promising regional hegemon, with great potential for expansion. The Bengal tiger may yet become the sovereign of all India."
 string_start_bahmanis:0 "The sack of §YDelhi§! in 1398 was a monumental event for the subcontinent, but in §YBidar§! it did not have the impact it did elsewhere. The §YBahmani§! Sultans declared their independence from the north 50 years prior and had already built a new state in the dry Deccani upland. Rich in economic assets, among others the fabled diamond mines of Golconda, the Sultans are now wealthier than most kings. Their court, and its fabled Turquoise throne, is famous beyond the subcontinent. Fame that greatly helps to attract the greedy and gifted from the wider Muslim world.\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate is also a troubled state. Cutting ties with the north has meant that it is without direct access to the west. At the same time the kingdom has a much smaller Muslim minority than most northern Sultanates and in its isolation even the most persianate of nobles have begun to adopt local culture and language. Newcomers and indigenized nobles often end up in conflict with each other and the new capital of Bidar has been built partly to avoid the intrigues of the old one in Gulbarga.\n\nNot far from the kingdom's southern border lies the City of Victory, §YVijayanagar§!. The city is the seat of the Sangama Rajas, and with its 400 000 inhabitants it is a very different place from the orderly fort city of Bidar. This is the capital of an Empire that stretches across Southern India and that has recently conquered almost the entire Tamil country in the far south. Vijayanagar is a formidable rival to Bahmani power, and has continued to advance on the contested zone between the two kingdoms. The seizure of the western Bahmani ports by agents of the Vijayanagara Empire is a strike right at the heart of the Sultanate's lifeline of immigration and imports.\n\nIn the east Kapilendra, founder of the Gajapati dynasty of §YOrissa§!, has orchestrated the sudden rise of his kingdom as a military power. Striking at §YJaunpur§!, §YBengal§!, Vijayanagar and Bahmani interests at the same time the new king has in short time made a name for himself as a conqueror. Should he choose to turn his attention south, towards §YAndhra§! and §YTelingana§!, his actions may shake up the deadlock entirely."
 string_start_tag_south_india:0 "Separated from Northern India by the Vindhya mountains and the hills and jungles of Gondwana and the Garjats, southern India is in many ways its own separate mega-region, often simply called 'Deccan' or 'the South'. It broke free of the §YDelhi§! Sultanate's clutches long before the §YTimurid§! sack of Delhi in 1398.\n\nIn §YOrissa§! Kapilendra Gajapati, 'Lord of the Elephants', has turned his regional kingdom into a major power. Drawing upon the loyalty of the Garjat jungle kingdoms and the devotees of Jagannath, he has assembled a great army that performs especially well in the jungles and hills of Eastern India. In short succession Kapilendra has won a number of great victories, each seemingly more unlikely than the next. Having defeated Jaunpur, Bengal, the Bahmanis and Vijayanagar in various regional conflicts, he is now greedily eyeing Telingana and the Andhran coastline. With 18 legitimate sons, Kapilendra must act prudently to avoid all his great conquests being lost upon his death.\n\nIn the central Deccani upland the §YBahmani§! Sultanate has been free of Delhi's overlordship for almost 100 years. The Sultans are rich beyond the wildest dreams of the people in their old homelands in Iran, Transoxiana and Arabia, yet they are also the masters of a state far from the entrenched Muslim aristocrats of northern India. Cut off from the north, the state has become dependent on immigration from the Muslim west as well as the acquisition of foreign war horses from overseas. The recent loss of the western coastline is, therefore, a catastrophe for the Sultanate, and steps have been taken to expand to the eastern coast instead, interfering in the internal politics of the Velamas of §YTelingana§! as well as the Reddys of §YAndhra§!.\n\nJust a short distance from the Bahmani capital in §YBidar§! lies §YVijayanagar§!, the 'City of Victory' and the capital of their main adversary. From their base near the Tungabhadra river, the Sangama Rajas have built a military base in the dry Deccani upland that they then used to conquer the entire Tamil country to the south. The Tamil lands are incredibly rich, and could likely fund the growing Viyanagara empire for decades, yet integration has not been easy. The rich Tamil trade guilds retain a lot of power and they are also an excellent base for usurpers.\n\nThe south is also home to a number of smaller states, anxiously watching the titanic struggle between Vijayanagar, the Bahmanis and the surging Orissa Kingdom. They bide their time and ensure that the spice continues to flow. For such trade states like §YKochin§!, §YCalicut§!, §YCannanore§! and §YVenad§! or the Sinhalese kingdoms this has been their livelihood for centuries. Others, like the chiefs of §YMysore§! or the last §YPandyas§! in Tirunelvelli can only hope that their martial abilities will mean that once an opportunity arises they can actually seize it, for nothing is forever, and perhaps even the great cities of old could fall..."

All founded by former generals under the defeated §YTughluq§! dynasty, the Sultans of §YBengal§! and §YJaunpur§! have declared their independence while the §YLodi§! governors of §YSirhind§! plan to seize the throne of Delhi for themselves.

These events are watched closely by Mewar's greatest rivals, the §YKhalji§! Sultans of §YMalwa§!. Overlords of several Gondi and Vindhyan kingdoms, the Sultans are ever eager to expand their court with new subjects.\n\nHome to India's most prosperous ports, the mercantile Sultanate §YGujarat§! reaps the economic benefits of being a global center of trade. What it lacks however is a notable military force to deter its jealous Rajput, Bahmani, and Vijayanagari neighbours. To this end, Sultan Muhammad Shah II seeks to conquer the nearby Hindu princes and build a realm capable of resisting any would-be invaders. Capitalizing on trade must also be a high priority for Gujarat, as gold can be as effective as land ownership when raising an army.\n\n§YNepal§! is plagued with disunity, with each generation leading to the creation of new petty kingdoms as the sons of kings inherit or carve out their own realms. The §YMalla§! Kings of Kathmandu, the rising §YGorkha§! Kingdom, and the §YLimbuwan§! tribes all covet control over the Kathmandu Valley. Nepal must also contend with the question of religion as Tibetan monks begin to settle and spread the Buddhist faith. The dream of a unified Nepal lives on, though there is not yet any clear candidate for its fulfilment.\n\nThe §YAhom§! Kingdom is on the rise in §YAssam§!. Founded in the 13th Century as a Shan Mong, it has become a cultural melting pot with a sophisticated method of government utilizing the Paik system of labour and administration.\n\nAs the endless cycle of the rise and fall of empires continues, all that is certain of the future is that war is coming to India."
