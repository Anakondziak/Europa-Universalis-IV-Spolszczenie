The competition for territory and access to the wealth of India requires diplomatic tact and some military muscle. But who is exploiting whom in this great game in the world’s most profitable markets?\n\nDharma provides a new way to define a government, though the introduction of Government Reforms. Different combinations of Reforms produce different governments- a kingdom could choose to empower the clergy and centralize the state, or cede power to a parliament and curtail the nobility.\n\nHow to rule and how to extend your rule- the choices are yours to make with Dharma."
