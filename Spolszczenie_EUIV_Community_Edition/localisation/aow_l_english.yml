In our state traders of many religions and cultures live side by side yet still keep apart to a certain extent. The biggest communities, those of the Gujaratis, Tamils, Javanese and Chinese all have their own respective obligations to the state and keeping the influence of these groups in balance is one of the most important tasks of any Malaccan monarch.\nThe ascension of Raja Ibrahim in 1444 has therefore ruffled quite a few feathers. Ibrahim was a practicing Hindu and came to be seen by many as a traditionalist aiming to roll back the influence of Islam in our country. It still came as a big surprise when the young king was found dead in his palace today. Many suspect that his prime minister, the royal Bendahara, must've had a hand in this but little can be proven."

The state ensures that these potential kings lack for nothing and this time of isolation may be used for study and contemplation by the princes. In order to protect the princes from the outside world, and in order to protect the kingdom from the claims of the princes, the mountain is kept under close guard.\nThis custom has served us well over the years and the kingdom has become much more stable than it once was. Still some feel that keeping all of our royal heirs in one place is quite risky.\nToday we find ourselves with an aging king and no heir to succeed, it is precisely in situations like these that the mountain might come in handy."
