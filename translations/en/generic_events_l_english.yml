 EVTDESC11102: "Your majesty has been presented with a formidable gift in the form of a Jade seal of some level of craftsmanship.

We need to ensure that natives under our care are protected from hostile neighbors, properly civilized and practice the true faith. Our plan is to give our colonists this duty, each will be given a number of natives to tutor and protect. This is obviously not something people will do for free so in return the natives will provide a number of days of labor to our colonists."

 ideagroups.910.d: "It is hard to fathom but for some reason the amount of income from trade has simply collapsed. The cargoes just don't seem to be landed. Is it smuggling? Is it merchants going elsewhere? We do not know but things are grim..."

 EVTDESC9000: "$MONARCHTITLE$! Word has just reached us of new lands in the Far East.

 EVTDESC9014: "Fumi-e (literally 'stepping-on-pictures') were objects produced during the Edo period to reveal hidden Christians. The practice consisted in forcing suspected Christians of trampling on Christian iconography to prove their 'innocence' with regards to secret Christian worship. A local daimyo has had success in combating the local Kirishitan community by applying this innovative method."
 EVTDESC9012: "The Western Embassy that we dispatched to Europe some time ago has now returned with rich spoils. You receive the leader of the expedition in your study. What would you like to hear about the far off lands and peoples he has seen?"
 EVTDESC9010: "The ship's tall mast stretches almost to the sky. Its sails are lowered now, but the ship lying low in the water speaks of a rich cargo. The Red Seal Ship has returned from a trading journey to the South Seas just today, bringing exotic goods from faraway lands."
 EVTDESC9018: "Traders in one of our provinces have brought in a party of Western Arquebuses for our armed forces. We could buy this state-of-the-art technology, but it will not be cheap, and the muskets will not last forever."
 EVTDESC9016: "A new delicacy has spread to one of our provinces where it has been given approval by local connoisseurs. The dish consists of battered and deep-fried vegetables and fish, and has become known as 'Tempura'. The dish has apparently been introduced by Portuguese missionaries!"
 EVTDESC9026: "One of your retainers has suggested that we build a 'Karesansui' (dry landscape) garden at a palace in one of our provinces. An impressive rock garden could be a cultural beacon for our clan for years to come, but, of course, there are costs associated with planning and building one."

 EVTDESC9024: "The Noh, or Nogaku, is a traditional Japanese form of musical drama, and the performance tonight of a newly written piece at our court in $CAPITAL$ has been hailed as the most beautiful play in several years."
 parlaments.1.d: "The city of $PROVINCENAME$ has grown rich and prosperous. They now want part in our parliament. The argument of their representatives seems to be centered around a statement about 'no taxation without representation'."
 EVTDESC9022: "A 'Ronin', a masterless Samurai, has offered his services at our court. The man is young, and his talents are not yet fully developed. We could either give the man a chance to develop these talents, or send him off to less prestigious posts."
 EVTDESC9020: "A play in the new Kabuki style of drama has been performed in $CAPITAL$, and we are set to gain. The performers are excellent, and one of them could potentially become a highly productive court playwright. On the other hand, having this troupe out on the road is bound to improve our standing in the eyes of others."

 culture_religion_events.21.d: "For a long time now the personal convictions of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have been at odds with the religious establishment of [Root.GetName]. This has caused both friction and conflict, with the clergy and leading nobles often questioning [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule. There are, however, many that now support [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in his devotion to the [Root.new_monarch_religion.GetReligionName] faith, both in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and the [Root.GetAdjective] countryside.\nPerhaps the time has come to make a great change to how the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] functions to its very core? Surely the defenders of the old would not go out willingly but if there is a will there is a way..."
 china_events.12.d: "For centuries the southern Empire has been richer and more populous than the north. It is in the south that many of the richest and most influential families have their roots, and it is in the south that the vast majority of the highest scoring in the Imperial Examinations are selected.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] worries that the southern families have an undue influence due to the many southerners in the Palatial administration. In the past quotas have been used to ensure that some part of those who pass the examinations originate from the north. Such quotas would, however, risk to undermine our entire system of merit as the guiding principle."

 EVTDESC9028: "Several of the Samurai in our service have served us long and faithfully. Tradition dictates that this caste of our most loyal warriors must be rewarded by their master for their service. Our people expect us to reward these Samurai, and not doing so will mean destabilizing our realm."
 EVTDESC9036: "One of the personal domains under our rulership still owes us outstanding taxes to the tune of 1000 koku of rice. Through communications with our tax collectors, the debtor has argued that his domain is overvalued and that he cannot afford to pay the taxes. We could forgive all or a part of the debt, but we could use the money."
 EVTDESC9034: "The season of the Cherry Blossoms is upon us! In every province of our Domain our people congregate at shrines and altars to pray, eat and enjoy the beauty of the season. Paper lanterns cast a warm nightly glow over our Han as we go to enjoy the festivities."
 china_events.25.t: "Rogue Diplomacy"
 EVTDESC9032: "It has been a long time since last we visited the principal shrines of one of our provinces. The Shrine is located off the beaten track, on top of a mountain said to be the abode of a very powerful kami. Normally we've gone there at least once every year, but it has been a while now. The attendants are expecting us, should we go visit the shrine?"
 EVTDESC9030: "The heavens have opened themselves and the rain outside falls a rattling tattoo on far off rooftops. A traveling monk has arrived at our doorsteps in $CAPITAL$, asking for food and lodgings. The monk has given a vow of poverty, and by tradition we are obliged to aid him."

They believe opening up more channels for trade and cooperation would be beneficial for both of our countries. Some would rather argue that [country_of_interest.GetName] should submit to the authority of The Middle Kingdom.\nThe foreign ambassador has been summoned to the imperial palace.

 EVTDESC9038: "The Geisha is the archetypal, female, Japanese entertainer, and in the last year one of the most well-known and well-liked Geishas in our domain died young after a short time of illness. The funeral has turned into a national day of sorrow as our Han mourns the passing of this beloved example of beauty."
 EVTDESC9046: "A European trader trafficking the waters around Japan has landed in our Han and offered to sell us a collection of treatises on western medicine, politics and astronomy. Buying these books would doubtless mean a shift in policy with regard to our Han's openness to trade, and such subversive tomes could destabilize the realm. Not buying the books might be a missed opportunity, but it will on the other hand force us to learn and discover for ourselves."
 EVTDESC9044: "The wealth of our lands is measured in 'Koku', with one Koku being the volume of rice required to feed one person for a year. While this is fairly easy to measure as such, several of the Provinces within our Domain have been consistently misvalued, since the Koku records have not been updated for several years. The outdated records, used among other things for tax collections, are becoming a source of growing discontent within our realm."
 desc_encomienda_system: "The Encomienda System gives each colonist a number of natives to tutor and protect and, in return, the natives will provide a number of days of labor to our colonists."
 EVTDESC9042: "Several local Daimyo swearing fealty to our realm have been conspiring against us for some time. The reason for these conspiracies among our own seems to be that many consider our rule to be illegitimate. The unruly Daimyo demand that we divest more power to them, or face an open rebellion."
 institution_events.601.d: "Merchants are reporting an influx of greater and greater numbers of foreign goods into our markets. Their point of origin is unclear but it is clear that somewhere production of refined goods has greatly increased."
 EVTDESC9040: "Disgrace! $MONARCHTITLE$, our Han is in a state of collapse, and the name of our family is quickly becoming a Japanese byword for failure and disgrace. While no one has dared suggest it to your face, the precedents of the ancestors are clear. Either we manage to turn the situation around quickly, or we should consider Seppuku, ritual suicide.

Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures.\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout Europe editions have grown and hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from religious and political pamphlets to instructions in how to behave or scientific treatises are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."

But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English Merchants and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."

The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery.

 EVTDESC2035: "The edict of tolerance, proclaimed by $MONARCH$ a short while back has proven to be nothing more than mere words. There have been several violent incidents and atrocities against religious minority groups since the declaration where $MONARCH$ has taken the stance of complete ignorance."
 EVTDESC2036: "Reports have reached us that the Emperor is planning to march against all Protestant states in the Empire. He is determined to cleanse the Holy Roman lands of all heretics before the end of the year. If we are to stay true to our faith, we'll have to make preparations."
 EVTDESC2038: "Our country has now recovered from the disastrous fractions of religious turmoil and is now together in one piece."
 EVTDESC2031: "Despite $MONARCH$'s effort to mediate between the different religious groups in our nation, conflicts have been erupting on a regular basis. The situation has worsened and without drastic measures, we will soon be engulfed in a religious civil war."
 EVTDESC2032: "In spite of rigorous attempts to eradicate heresy, the population of some of our provinces are strongly attached to their faith and are still resisting conversion."
 EVTDESC2033: "Our country's harsh subjugation of heretics hasn't brought the expected results. Instead of restoring order and bringing our nation under one religious faith, our actions have further agitated the population leading to increased violence and acts of cruelty."
 EVTDESC2034: "Even though attempts have been made to transform our society into a more tolerant one, violent outbursts and riots are becoming more common. The violence has escalated and atrocities are being committed on both sides, widening the religious chasm and threatening to tear our country apart from within."
 institution_events.400.d: "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways the early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as Venetian Printer Aldus Manutius, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures.\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout Europe editions have grown and hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from religious and political pamphlets to instructions in how to behave or scientific treatises are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."

 EVTDESC2063: "According to the governor of $PROVINCENAME$, the citizens are in uproar because of our missionaries' complete lack of respect for any religious practices or traditions different from their own.

In practice, these rules often went unenforced, but as our realm shifts further toward a legalistic interpretation of Islam, key members of the Ulema are beginning to call for their stricter implementation."

 EVTDESC5085: "Monarchs were often struggling with ways to subdue the nobility. The rise of firearms reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with, in the eyes of the monarchs, too much idle time. Some monarchs created great new palaces with elaborate court rituals to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied. Versailles is the greatest expression of this movement."
 EVTDESC5088: "Disputes over the treatment of local merchants were not uncommon. All governments faced minor reports of unfair treatment and harassment of their merchants.

Sometimes, these requests for redress would be directed at the local lord who was perceived to be violating the peasants' rights.

We were left with no choice but to limit the old King's ability to influence the government by removing his head. Although diehard monarchists were convinced that the King would soon grow another one, this was not the case. Now a purely temporary committee of public safety has been appointed, which includes the leaders of the initial revolution and an over-ambitious general. Our regime's future of liberty and equality at home would be bright but we seem to have annoyed every crowned head of Europe.

By creating Manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that prevent mass production in principle as well as pioneer ways to increase production through organizing and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
