 canal_events.EVTDESC8: "Our idea to reward the workers on our canal project in [Root.GetName] with increased rations of alcohol seems to have unwanted effects. Increased drunkenness was expected but it also seems to have increased the death toll among those already weakened by dysentery and fever."
 canal_events.EVTDESC7: "Severe floods have caused a lot of damage in [Root.GetName] and have thus delayed the construction of the canal. Unless it receives additional funds the project risks getting delayed."
 religious_events.17.d: "The rise of a Hindu dynasty in [From.GetName] has enraged the Muslim establishment in the area. A Muslim convert from the [From.Dynasty.GetName] has now been enthroned to avoid an outright revolt while still keeping the dynasty in power."

 canal_events.EVTDESC3: "In light of the many setbacks and hardships that have plagued our canal project in [Root.GetName], it's not surprising to hear that the local leadership has become dispirited and that much of the workforce has sunk into apathy.

 religious_events.16.d: "The sizeable Muslim community of [Root.GetName] has been raising objections to the coronation of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As the old Muslim aristocrats and clergy remain very influential in our country and still hold many positions of power within our state this is not a small problem. It has been suggested that perhaps the situation might be defused by [Root.Monarch.GetName] abdicating in favor of a relative who would then convert to Islam. This would allow power to remain with the [Root.Dynasty.GetName] family while still placating the Ulema and leading aristocrats.

 flavor_fra.EVTDESC101: "As First Consul of France, Napoleon Bonaparte faced several plots and assassination attempts carried out by Jacobins and royalists, often sponsored by members of the Bourbon dynasty - the former rulers of the country. Thinking it would be more difficult to carry out a Bourbon restoration if the Bonaparte succession was secured in the constitution, Napoleon decided to re-create the hereditary monarchy in France and had himself crowned emperor by Pope Pius VII on 2 December 1804 at Notre-Dame."
 flavor_fra.EVTDESC100: "The 'Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise' was an assassination attempt on the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of France, in Paris on 24 December 1800. The attempt was carried out by seven royalists who had connections to the earlier Chouan Revolt. A bomb hidden in a barrel loaded on a parked cart exploded just as Napoleon and his escort were passing by on the way to the Opéra to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' The bomb, nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse. The explosion killed several bystanders but failed to hurt Napoleon."
