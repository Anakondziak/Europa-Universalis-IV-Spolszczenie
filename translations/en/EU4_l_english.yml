This would soon prove to be the start of a revolution in Indian warfare as infantry rather than cavalry increasingly came to be the determining factor in battles. Under Dupleix and de Bussy Telegu soldiers started to fight and arm themselves in a manner more similar to the European armies of the time. These troops were known as Telingas after their area of origin (Telingana) but soon the term came to be used about musket armed and uniformed infantry troops in other parts of India."

During the first half of the 18th century as Maratha power grew and as infantry increasingly became organized in the European fashion there came a need for more organized cavalry regiments. From the 1720s and onwards the size and level of organization of Indian cavalry armies would increase to attempt to match the development of infantry and artillery tactics that now took place. It would take some time before seasoned Indian generals would realize just how vulnerable their focus on the cavalry arm could make them against the drilled European-style musket regiments that became increasingly common during the 1700s."

Due to their familiarity with the weapons these tribesmen soon became the primary musketmen in southern India. The Maratha armies in particular came to rely on these tribal groups for recruiting infantry to their armies. The tribal organization of the troops was often kept, with the headmen serving as officers. Berads and Mavales would increasingly be deployed in Maratha, Mughal and Mysorean armies during the 17th and 18th centuries and would eventually form the core of future European-style infantry regiments in the area."

As the other states in northern India tried to catch up with the Mughal military machine many of them came to rely increasingly on the use of Central Asian adventurers as cavalry officers.
