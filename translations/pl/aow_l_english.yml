The outskirts of [Root.GetCapitalName] have been plundered in this war to the point of starvation. They are now reaching out for the government to aid them in recovering, lest the suffering of [Root.Owner.GetName] drag on for years past the eventual peace."

 aow_events.2.d: "Sieges can be costly both in time and lives, and we normally take whatever measures necessary to finish them quickly. A siege in the ongoing war has happened to occur close to the border, sparking a discussion about how far the soldiers should go in raiding the countryside.\n\nThe nation on the other side is not our enemy in this war, but perhaps if some of their hamlets were raided, seemingly by mistake, they would understand. The siege could be greatly aided by these supplies."

 aow_events.10.d: "Despite the plague sweeping the war-torn land, both the relentless defending forces and our daring attackers laying siege to their fortress in [From.GetName] refused to back down. The mutual stubbornness has caused major losses for the civilian population of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName], tearing down the infrastructure and making the siege even more difficult."

 aow_events.11.t: "Spread of Pestilence"
 aow_events.11.d: "The war has worsened the spread of diseases, and what once started as a local epidemic centered around a siege has now spread further. Dislocated civilians as well as troop movements, both difficult to avoid in wartime, has facilitated this and now [Root.GetName] has also fallen victim to the illness."
 aow_events.11.a: "Curse this war..."
 aow_events.12.t: "Cruelty of Mercenaries"
 aow_events.12.d: "War is seldom without brutality. Soldiers are not known for their mercy, but this war has seen some exceptionally vile behavior on part of our occupying forces. It appears that mercenaries, unsatisfied with the wages we provide them with, have resorted to robbing the civilian population. Extortion by means of terror and torture has become commonplace, [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers are reviled as well as feared and stories of their atrocities spread beyond the borders of the war."
 aow_events.12.a: "We should prevent this from happening in the future."
 aow_events.12.b: "Bellum se ipsum alet! Let them take what they want."
 aow_events.13.t: "Mercenary Bands Raid [Root.GetName]"
 aow_events.13.d: "The enemy occupation of [Root.GetName] came at a great cost for its people. Whether driven by greed or desperation, soldiers of fortune working with the occupying forces plundered and terrorized local civilians in an attempt to extort money and resources."
 aow_events.13.a: "Greed corrupts men's hearts..."
 aow_events.14.t: "Displaced Refugees from [Root.GetName]"
 aow_events.14.d: "The lingering effects of the war still plague [Root.Owner.GetName]. Some areas have been destroyed to the point of becoming nearly uninhabitable, and people have been forced to move around to survive under these conditions. Some people have left [Root.GetName] entirely, settling in neighboring provinces where the war has left less scars."
 aow_events.14.a: "The war may be over, but our troubles are not."
 aow_events.15.t: "The Families Left Behind"
 aow_events.15.d: "The recent war took a heavy toll on our people. Many were called, few returned. The families of nobles and commoners alike toiled as they waited for soldiers to return home, but the war ended and they never did. Now the toiling continues, many being so preoccupied with the work to make up for the lost pair of hands that they barely have time to grieve. Of the ones who have time to think, many are increasingly thinking that we have been throwing away lives too carelessly."
 aow_events.15.a: "We can ease the tax burden on the bereaved."
 aow_events.15.b: "Let us be more lenient drafting for the army in the future."
 aow_events.15.c: "This is the price that must be paid for our glorious nation."
 aow_events.16.t: "Czarnoksi²stwo"
 aow_events.16.d: "The people of the war-torn city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are looking for reasons for the misfortunes that have befallen them. Fortunately, they have not found them to be related to our rulership, but unfortunately, what they have found has caused quite a stir. The prolonged effects of the war and how they seem to affect some more than others, they claim, can only be the work of those practicing witchcraft and sorcery.\n\nAccusations have been leveled generously, and there are local authorities willing to organize proper trials for these crimes. As proper as trials for magic get in [Root.GetName], anyway."
 aow_events.16.a: "Allow them to proceed with the local trials."
 aow_events.16.b: "$INQUISITOR$ can see to these matters in a more organized fashion."
 aow_events.16.c: "Such foolish superstitions have no place in [Root.Owner.GetName]!"
 aow_events.17.t: "Witch-hunt"
 aow_events.17.d: "Since the long-suffering people in [Root.GetName] received the blessing of the state and church to prosecute those who allegedly brought famine and disease upon them by means of witchcraft, they have made good use of it. While once only the obviously suspicious were pointed out, witches now appear to be everywhere. The crowd calls for the spilling of peasant and noble blood alike, and even some of the local clergy may not be trustworthy.\n\nThis abundance of satanic practices certainly goes a long way to explain the post-war hardships of [Root.GetName], but the mass trials that have followed are going out of hand. We might consider the possibility that some are innocent."
 aow_events.17.a: "Cease this madness!"
 aow_events.17.b: "Intervene on behalf of the nobles."
 aow_events.17.c: "Intervene on behalf of the commoners."
 aow_events.17.e: "Let them exact justice as they see fit."
 aow_events.18.t: "A Witch from Foreign Lands"
 aow_events.18.d: "Being able to recognize witches and sorcerers with certainty is a rare gift, which we do not know on whom God will bestow. Fortunately, being able to recognize them with uncertainty based on strange or unusual behavior or successes is a very common gift with the added benefit of more consistently targeting people who are somewhat maladjusted.\n\nSometimes, however, it can be inconvenient. Locals in [Root.GetName] have recently pointed out a foreign noblewoman as a witch. Prosecuting her might cause a diplomatic incident, but not intervening might be seen as a sign of lacking faith."
 aow_events.18.a: "This fear of the unfamiliar must be stopped."
 aow_events.18.b: "Witches, spies, who know what they're up to?"
 aow_events.19.t: "A Highly Troubling Accusation"
 aow_events.19.d: "Under the watchful eye of $INQUISITOR$, trials for sorcery and heresy have proceeded under relatively controlled circumstances. $INQUISITOR_CAP_ADJ$ would not be at our court if we did not trust $INQUISITORO_PRONOUN$, after all. A recent event has complicated this, however, as $INQUISITOR_ADJ$ has challenged our trust of another. $STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$, who has aided [Root.GetName] greatly in foreign relations, has been accused of witchcraft, a testament to no one being truly unquestionable.\n\n$STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$ claims that $INQUISITOR$ is supporting these accusations out of pure jealousy. Political drama may be behind all this, but then again, we have trusted our inquisitor so far."
 aow_events.19.a: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
 aow_events.19.b: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."
 aow_events.20.t: "The Fires of Hell"
 aow_events.20.d: "$INQUISITOR$ has been diligent. With the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s support, those who practice witchcraft are condemned and burned, on Earth as it is in Hell. Our merciless prosecution of these crimes has put our religious devotion beyond reproach.\n\nStill, there are moments of doubt. One day, your young heir [Root.Heir.GetName] watches the public execution of a witch for the first time. You see [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] eyes fill up with terror in the firelight, and before it's through, your child is begging for the witch to be spared. Your attempts to explain do nothing to stop the tears, and eventually you find yourself at a loss to justify this to an innocent mind. Perhaps the convicted is innocent too, and you will once burn yourself, eternally."
 aow_events.20.a: "The child is right. We have been blinded by our zeal."
 aow_events.20.b: "Hush child, and hope no one heard that..."
 aow_events.21.t: "Unknown Shooter"
 aow_events.21.d: "[Root.GetName] has a recent history of war, and the [Root.GetAdjective] people increasingly doubt its purposes, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] persists in leading the army ever forward. The soldiers are weary, with many wishing to return home. We have never had reason to consider how badly.\n\nUntil this day. While the troops prepared to face the enemy, a shot rang out, and the king fell to the ground, dead. An enemy sharpshooter? A plot by claimants for the throne? Or maybe this was just how badly someone wanted to leave all this behind."
 aow_events.21.a: "We may never know."
 aow_events.22.t: "A Change of Character"
 aow_events.22.d: "After the war ended, our ardent diplomatic advisor $DIPLOMAT$ has repeatedly implored [Root.Monarch.GetName] not only to shift foreign policy to avoid future bloodshed, but even suggested that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should change [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] priorities as a ruler.\n\n'As long as the people see their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] preparing for war, how can they do anything but blame us when war is upon them?' $DIPLOMAT$ asks. 'It is not merely what the people want. It is what this nation needs.'"
 aow_events.22.a: "You are right, [Root.GetName] needs peace."
 aow_events.22.b: "Forsake the spirit that called me to war? Ridiculous."
 aow_events.23.t: "The Faithful in Enemy Lands"
 aow_events.23.d: "Many soldiers see our ongoing war as a conflict of faiths. This has led to some debate around one of our ongoing sieges, where the local population are good [Root.Religion.GetName]s. Normally, our troops would supply the siege by taking what we need from the locals, but the pious in our army think we should spare our [Root.Religion.GetName] brothers and sisters, even at the cost of the siege dragging out for longer. Which comes first among the [Root.GetAdjective], faith or war?"
 aow_events.23.a: "Spare the faithful."
 aow_events.23.b: "No mercy for enemies of [Root.GetName]!"
 aow_events.24.t: "[Root.GetName] Betrayed by Brothers in Faith"
 aow_events.24.d: "When the [Root.Religion.GetName] fools of [Root.GetName] were first attacked by our enemies, they shared their faith, despite our best efforts to make them see the light. Now, having suffered the brutal onslaught of the war, they have seen just how shallow the morality of the [Root.Religion.GetName] really is. After being besieged and raided by the people they trusted, they have bitterly thrown aside their old beliefs, and swore allegiance not only to our country, but to our religion."
 aow_events.24.a: "We will show them the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith has more integrity than that."
 aow_events.25.t: "Unbelievers in [Root.GetName] Waver"
 aow_events.25.d: "While most of our nation fears the [Root.Religion.GetName] invaders, a few citizens seem to welcome them. After [Root.GetName] fell to the enemy, its inhabitants seem to have started considering if they'd be better off in a country headed by rulers of their own faith. In an effort of mitigate this betrayal, the local rulers have sent a messenger to our court, requesting promises of a more hands-off approach to religious matters in [Root.GetName]. Otherwise, the enemy may already have a hold on the province."
 aow_events.25.a: "We will reward loyalty with respect."
 aow_events.25.b: "We will not accept disloyalty."
 aow_events.26.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Defectors"
 aow_events.26.d: "The wise and spiritually enlightened people of [From.GetName] have found, after we occupied their land, that they might benefit from joining us. After all, [From.Owner.GetName] is a [From.Owner.Religion.GetName] country, with little understanding of their ways. If the war goes well, this will certainly help."
 aow_events.26.a: "We may be able to accommodate them..."
 aow_events.27.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] of [Root.GetName] Betray Us!"
 aow_events.27.d: "Our war against the [Root.Religion.GetName] has not gone unnoticed by their local supporters. In [Root.GetName], traitors who hold faith before country have taken the opportunity to rise up and attack us, perhaps hoping to aid the enemy or encourage other [Root.Religion.GetName] nations to join the war."
 aow_events.27.a: "Faith determines the path of all, even the wicked."
 aow_events.28.t: "Struggle Without, Struggle Within"
 aow_events.28.d: "Sometimes, we see conflicts on the international stage mirrored within our own borders. Today, we received news that our war with the [Root.Religion.GetName]s has brought about a religious conflict in [Root.GetName], where the [Root.Religion.GetName] and [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faiths exist side by side. People who used to be neighbors and friends are attacking each other over what they perceive as the differences between us and our adversaries."
 aow_events.28.a: "Like the war, this conflict must take its course."
 aow_events.28.b: "Unite against the true enemy! You are all [Root.Owner.GetAdjective]!"
 aow_events.29.t: "Country Before Faith"
 aow_events.29.d: "Our relation to the religious dissidents in [Root.GetName] has varied, but at least some of the local [Root.Religion.GetName] citizens seem to appreciate our leadership. 'Seem to' may be a key phrase in the situation, because they have recently approached us with an offer to use their religious ties in one of our rival countries to strengthen our international spy network. Provided that they can be relied upon, they could provide a rare and valuable asset..."
 aow_events.29.a: "We will trust them to remain loyal to us."
 aow_events.29.b: "There is no need for such underhanded tactics... or risks."
 aow_events.30.t: "Warriors of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Faith"
 aow_events.30.d: "The more zealous among the [Root.Religion.GetName] of [Root.GetName] have long kept watch at the border, suspicious of the motives of the unbelievers on the other side. Now, they find their suspicions confirmed by the open declaration of war. Prepared and willing to give their lives for the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause, their local militia has joined our forces in the battle against the invading army."
 aow_events.30.a: "Forward, sentinels of the truth!"
 aow_events.31.t: "Early Reformers"
 aow_events.31.d: "When news of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith spread to our land, we were among the first to accept it. We know where the future of the Christian faith lies and while less enlightened nations may take their time to get there and need to be dragged along, we march proudly towards it.\n\nFortunately, we are not surrounded by these fools on all sides. The rulers of a neighboring country have taken the same admirable path, freeing themselves from the clutches of the Pope and educating themselves in [Root.Religion.GetName] theology. The Church of [Root.GetName] may hold the foremost scholars, but there may yet be much to learn from others."
 aow_events.31.a: "Together we will spread God's true message!"
 aow_events.31.b: "The Church of [Root.GetName] stands alone."
 aow_events.32.t: "Neither [Root.Religion.GetName] nor Catholic"
 aow_events.32.d: "[Root.Religion.GetName] preachers are not the only ones to stand up against the Catholic Church. Scholars from different movements are questioning their corrupt doctrine, perhaps not in perfect tune with our own criticism, but nevertheless highly relevant. One of our neighboring nations is home to one such movement. In these tumultuous times, can we really afford to quibble over theological disagreements when we could work together? It could benefit us, if they show the same open-mindedness."
 aow_events.32.a: "We will stand with them against the Pope, if they stand with us."
 aow_events.32.b: "They spread lies, merely different lies."
 aow_events.33.t: "[From.Religion.GetName] Neighbors Reach Out"
 aow_events.33.d: "The Church of [From.GetName] is far from being in full agreement with the Church of [Root.GetName] in many spiritual matters, but in one worldly matter we agree##CHAR_DETECT## the hegemony of the Pope and the Patriarchs cannot be accepted by true Christians. This, to them, is clearly sufficient reason to cooperate, despite them being [From.Religion.GetName] and us being [Root.Religion.GetName]. What takes precedence, the political reality of our common enemy, or our church doctrine?"
 aow_events.33.a: "Together, we can return Christianity to what it was meant to be."
 aow_events.33.b: "The last thing we need is theological confusion in our own ranks."
 aow_events.34.t: "[From.Religion.GetName] Neighbors Accept"
 aow_events.34.d: "Our generous gesture towards [From.GetName] has paid off. Despite our differences, their [From.Religion.GetName] leaders have conceded that we, as the vanguard of the Reformation, should attempt to unite our causes for the greater good."
 aow_events.34.a: "The pious of [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName] will remember this day."
 aow_events.35.t: "[From.Religion.GetName] Neighbors Reject Our Charity"
 aow_events.35.d: "The foolishly dogmatic Church of [From.GetName] are apparently too set in their ways to do diplomacy with those who try to aid them. Maybe our [Root.Religion.GetName] ways seem just as misguided to them as the policies of the Holy See."
 aow_events.35.a: "Do they not know to love their neighbor as themselves?"
 aow_events.36.t: "Heretics Encroach On Our Land"
 aow_events.36.d: "While we have worked hard to root out the heretical confusion that seeks to undermine the Christian faith, just across our borders, a nation has embraced it. Perhaps they think we've failed to notice that they have allowed those who reject the Catholic Church to set the agenda in their capital, spreading their lies rapidly from it. Perhaps they think we've failed to notice that our own country has seen provinces turned from the true faith. Have we?"
 aow_events.36.a: "No, we can see all too well what must be done."
 aow_events.36.b: "We can certainly pretend to."
 aow_events.37.t: "The Cause of the Protestant Plague"
 aow_events.37.d: "Normally, each nation's rabble is their own concern. Not so when another nation openly espouses the same spiritual rot as the rabble. Many among both the clergy and military draw a straight line between the Protestant revolters we fight today and the dedication to the Protestant cause shown by our neighbors. We cannot remain a respected and feared nation in the eyes of others if we do not confront them about their support, explicit or implicit, of the heretics who assault the [Root.GetAdjective] lands."
 aow_events.37.a: "They better have an answer for us!"
 aow_events.37.b: "Let us not stir up more trouble over this."
 aow_events.38.t: "The Cause of the Calvinist Plague"
 aow_events.38.d: "Normally, each nation's rabble is their own concern. Not so when another nation openly espouses the same spiritual rot as the rabble. Many among both the clergy and military draw a straight line between the Reformed revolters we fight today and the dedication to the Reformed cause shown by our neighbors. We cannot remain a respected and feared nation in the eyes of others if we do not confront them about their support, explicit or implicit, of the heretics who assault the [Root.GetAdjective] lands."
 aow_events.38.a: "They better have an answer for us!"
 aow_events.38.b: "Let us not stir up more trouble over this."
 aow_events.39.t: "[From.GetName] Confronts Us About Rebels"
 aow_events.39.d: "Apparently, the [From.GetAdjective] government's decision to enforce the Catholic faith in their lands has been a mistake in more ways than one. Their [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects have revolted against them, which more than a few of those affected blame on our support of the true faith.\n\nNow, an ambassador from [From.GetName] has openly confronted us about this issue, and rather imperiously demanded that we renounce the rebels and their struggle. While we certainly would like to see the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, this is a diplomatic issue more than a religious one. What is our stance on these foreign rebels?"
 aow_events.39.a: "Cuius regio, eius religio. They should respect the will of their rulers."
 aow_events.39.b: "We demand that you cease your oppression of these poor [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects!"
 aow_events.39.c: "We will support the faithful against you, openly and gladly!"
 aow_events.40.t: "[From.GetName] Renounces [From.Religion.GetName] Rebels"
 aow_events.40.d: "Whatever troubles we may have with the [From.Religion.GetName] scum within our own borders, we can console ourselves with the fact that the international leaders of their faith distance themselves from this rebellion. [From.GetName] have promised us that regardless of their own beliefs, they consider the revolt against our rule unacceptable."
 aow_events.40.a: "Let us hope this is not just duplicitous talk."
 aow_events.41.t: "[From.GetName] Defend [From.Religion.GetName] Rebels"
 aow_events.41.d: "Apparently the [From.Religion.GetName] in [From.GetName] are more brazen about the trouble they cause than we thought. When confronted about the fact that their brothers and sisters in faith are rioting in our streets, their response was that we brought this upon ourselves by disrespecting their heretical beliefs."
 aow_events.41.a: "If that's how they see things, they can hardly hope to retain our respect."
 aow_events.42.t: "[From.GetName] Funds [From.Religion.GetName] Rebels!"
 aow_events.42.d: "Our efforts to get [From.GetName] to take responsibility for the heresy they spread seem to have backfired. Not only have they embraced the rebel movement against our state religion, they have openly incited more riots, causing the heretics to grow even more confident in their cause. Every drop of Catholic blood spilled on our soil by these maniacs is now on their hands."
 aow_events.42.a: "There can be no absolution for those who persist in sin."
 aow_events.43.t: "Cardinal Across the Border"
 aow_events.43.d: "Sometimes, we have the chance to set something into motion without seeming to have done anything. One such chance has arrived recently, when a cardinal living on the soil of one of our neighbors admitted to an agent from [Root.GetName] that he would consider moving across the border and support us in the Curia for a price. While this may be tempting, there may be a greater price to pay if we take advantage of this##CHAR_DETECT## the wrath of the country he deserts."
 aow_events.43.a: "We will take our chances that they never find out."
 aow_events.43.b: "It is not worth risking, but the man who found him deserves a promotion."
 aow_events.44.t: "Cardinal Bribed to Move"
 aow_events.44.d: "A cardinal who had previously stayed in [Root.GetName], close to the border, has now moved out of our nation entirely and shifted his allegiance to our neighbors. The [From.GetAdjective] agents who bribed him to betray us probably thought we would not notice their hand in the matter, but they were wrong. This intentional sabotage of our influence in the Curia is unacceptable and will not stand unchallenged."
 aow_events.44.a: "It is an affront to both us and our Church."
 aow_events.45.t: "Thoughts of Heresy"
 aow_events.45.d: "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has lived close to the heretics in our nation and rather than condemn them, he has tried to understand them. While a sympathetic course of action, he has recently approached one of our ministers confessing that he has himself started to doubt Church doctrine. If this came to the Pope's knowledge, he would no longer be allowed to serve in the Curia, but perhaps we could convince him to keep this to himself for a few ducats."
 aow_events.45.a: "Faith cannot be bought, but silence can."
 aow_events.45.a.tt: "the Pope discovering our actions."
 aow_events.45.b: "It's unfortunate, but he is ill suited for his position if he has doubts."
 aow_events.46.t: "Pope Discovers Duplicity"
 aow_events.46.d: "The cardinal we bribed to keep silent about his doubts of Church doctrine unfortunately still believed in confessing his sins. Even more unfortunately, the manner in which he did this to the Pope has not granted him forgiveness, perhaps because he does not truly regret his doubts. While he does regret taking our bribe, this too has come to the knowledge of the Holy Father, who is displeased with us as much as the now former cardinal."
 aow_events.46.a: "Is it too late for us to ask forgiveness, too?"
 aow_events.47.t: "Cardinal Distrusts Heathens"
 aow_events.47.d: "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has been loyal to [Root.Owner.GetName] so far, but is starting to have doubts about his continued stay here after seeing heathens living so close to his home city of [Root.GetCapitalName]. In a letter to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle], he has claimed that these people cannot be trusted and requested that they be subject to much more stringent regulations than our other citizens."
 aow_events.47.a: "If we cannot judge someone's character by faith, what else?"
 aow_events.47.b: "We have no intentions of limiting their rights because of one man."
 aow_events.48.t: "Contacts in the Holy See"
 aow_events.48.d: "$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$, being a wise and respected Catholic, has maintained good relations with cardinals and other people in the Church even outside the borders of [Root.GetName]. They recently discovered that a man who has just been promoted to cardinal, who is also a good friend of theirs, is considering moving to our country to facilitate their mutual work on a theological text. If we aided this process, we would have a cardinal in the Curia who is not only loyal to $THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$, but also to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 aow_events.48.a: "Whatever we can do to help, we will."
 aow_events.48.b: "Our administration has other priorities than nepotism."
 aow_events.49.t: "Cardinal Minister"
 aow_events.49.d: "One of the cardinals in [Root.GetName] has proven to be a skilled administrator and already provides useful advice to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. At this point, making him a minister in our government would almost be only a formality, but an important formality nonetheless, since he may grow more powerful yet. Having a cardinal in our service would certainly lend us credibility with the Pope and strengthen the sentiment that [Root.GetName] is a Catholic nation first and foremost."
 aow_events.49.a: "He has aided us well so far, so let us get the formality over with."
 aow_events.49.b: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] does not need his advice to rule [Root.GetName]."
 aow_events.50.t: "Cardinal's Policies Upset Nobles"
 aow_events.50.d: "Since we made one of our cardinals a minister in our government, he has gone far beyond providing theological insights and innovated significantly in the administration of [Root.GetName]. Unfortunately, his suggestions of centralizing power are not possible without removing some authority from the nobles, who have begun to see him as an opportunist. At this point, trying to remove him from office over this dispute would probably mean we lost his loyalty altogether, but the nobles who stand to lose from his plans consider this a sacrifice easily worth making."
 aow_events.50.a: "The minister is showing us the path to the future."
 aow_events.50.b: "He has overstepped his authority and should be dismissed."
 aow_events.51.t: "Cardinal Sins"
 aow_events.51.d: "While conducting espionage in one of our neighboring countries, our operatives shadowed a powerful man, a cardinal, and discovered that although his loyalty appears incorruptible, his morals are already corrupt beyond what the Church can possibly imagine. Although the details of his transgressions are not of interest to us, they may be of interest to the Pope and give us a chance to weaken our neighbor's influence in the Curia. On the other hand, having a hold on a man of his rank could be useful in many situations."
 aow_events.51.a: "The Holy See must be informed of his actions."
 aow_events.51.b: "We can use this as blackmail to improve our spy network."
 aow_events.52.t: "Cardinal Exposed"
 aow_events.52.d: "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has been rumored to be of weak character, but has always been discrete enough not to warrant further investigation. Now it appears that foreign spies from [From.GetName] who have had their eye on him put an end to this and exposed his sins to the Pope. His days as a cardinal are numbered, and our power in the Curia will be weakened due to this untimely [From.GetAdjective] intervention."
 aow_events.52.a: "What an underhanded way of getting at our influence."
 west_african.1.t: "The Sultanate of [Root.GetName]"
 west_african.1.d: "Our people have come a long way from their origins. Where there were once many tribes with their own customs and leaders, people throughout [Root.GetName] now recognize [Root.Monarch.GetName] as their ruler. Many have speculated that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may soon declare [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] Sultan, but this may not go without contention unless the title is given to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by the Caliph.\n\nWord has reached us that the Ottoman Caliphate has its seat in the distant city of Istanbul and they may just be willing to grant us an audience. Perhaps with the Caliph's blessing, the Sultanate of [Root.GetName] will find support among the faithful of its citizens."
 west_african.1.a: "Let us travel to this faraway land and seek their support!"
 west_african.1.b: "We do not need their approval to reign!"
 west_african.2.t: "A Sultan in [From.GetName]"
 west_african.2.d: "An emissary has arrived from the lands of [From.GetName], seeking support from [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] capacity as Caliph for the creation of a new sultanate. Once a collection of disparate tribes, we are informed that the [From.GetAdjective] people are now pious Muslims and devoted to their ruler, [From.Monarch.GetName], who wishes to seize the title of Sultan with our support."
 west_african.2.a: "A noble goal. The foundation of a new sultanate is a blessing to us as well."
 west_african.2.b: "If you wish to be Sultan, you must convince the people yourself."
 west_african.3.t: "Caliph Approves of Sultanate"
 west_african.3.d: "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, bringing news of how the leader of the Muslim world has decreed that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now the Sultan of [Root.GetName]. What may have otherwise turned into a violent struggle for power and political upheaval will now see the support of most, maybe all, of the wise and faithful among the [Root.GetAdjective] people."
 west_african.3.a: "Only the unbelievers will oppose us now."
 west_african.4.t: "Caliph Disapproves of Sultanate"
 west_african.4.d: "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, but despite our best efforts, the Caliph would not grant us the title. According to [From.Monarch.GetHerHim], it is up to us to convince the people of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s capacity to rule as Sultan."
 west_african.4.a: "A Caliph displaying such poor judgment is hardly fit for the title."
 west_african.5.t: "People of the Desert"
 west_african.5.d: "The [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people have lived in this arid climate for a long time. Although this causes some foolish nations to dismiss us as inhabiting the land unwanted by others, we have mastered skills of survival and combat that they would be wise to fear.\n\nJust across the border at [Root.GetName], our brethren are suffering the oppression of other people, people who may not be prepared for what the [Root.Culture.GetName] are capable of when you underestimate them. With the help of these locals, we could organize a raid into the lands of their oppressors, striking quickly and taking advantage of the fact that we know the desert there better than anyone else."
 west_african.5.a: "We will arrive and withdraw like a sandstorm."
 west_african.5.b: "We will not assault our neighbors like this, regardless of who their subjects are."
 west_african.6.t: "Desert Raiders"
 west_african.6.d: "Some people from the [Root.Culture.GetName] elite have recently been attacked by what they believe to be a raid organized by foreign military. Initially, the attack seemed to have occurred too deep into our borders for this to be possible, but an explanation for how this could have happened has begun to take shape. The [From.Culture.GetName] in one of our border provinces, who we thought to be our loyal subjects, appear to have conspired with our neighbors to organize the attack.\n\nWhile it may not be possible to retaliate in kind, there are other ways we can show what we think of such cowardly tactics."
 west_african.6.a: "Sooner or later, they will pay."
 west_african.7.t: "A Safer Border"
 west_african.7.d: "A long time has passed, but we have not forgotten how [Root.GetName] once served as an entry point for an audacious attack to plunder our country. Many people believe that this threat remains real, and demands that the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] act upon it, strengthening our control of the border and ensuring that desert raiders are not allowed to cross it ever again."
 west_african.7.a: "We will dispatch the necessary troops immediately."
 west_african.7.b: "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] will travel to patrol the border [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]!"
 west_african.7.c: "Surely some local initiative can be arranged."
 west_african.8.t: "Wasteland to Some"
 west_african.8.d: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have always been resourceful and adaptive beyond what others would consider possible, and lands others may find impossible to inhabit or even traverse are our homes, our roads and our domain. We could made good use of this, including in our country's trade efforts. One of our main trade routes is in fact right next to such an area, and there have been discussions about how to best take advantage of this."
 west_african.8.a: "We can send our caravans on routes that we alone know."
 west_african.8.b: "It can be used as a base to stage an attack on the trade route."
 west_african.9.t: "Idolatry or Reverence?"
 west_african.9.d: "Our efforts to bring salvation to the heathens in [Root.GetName] have borne fruit, but it is a strange and unfamiliar fruit. The local population has started to accept Christ, but the faith has been intertwined with their old ways. Angels and spirits, the true Lord and the old Lord of the Sky, the Blessed Virgin and the Earth Goddess... do these people really believe in what they hear, or do they simply call their old idols by different names? The local missionary has come to us for advice, concerned about the souls of the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people, and his own."
 west_african.9.a: "Their faith is pure, and we would be fools to reject it."
 west_african.9.b: "This is worse than heresy. It must be rooted out."
 west_african.10.t: "God of the Sky"
 west_african.10.d: "We trust in the spirits, in the gods that have always been with us, and our people are rarely impressed by the lies of those who would lead us from them. However, some people on our border who have come into contact with those who worship one they claim returned from the dead seem to have seen similarities between their faith and ours. Just as many here choose to worship the Sky Father, our neighbors speak of the one the call Christ as having a Heavenly Father himself. Many have begun to suggest that these two may be one and the same, and that the animosity between our faiths is nothing but a misunderstanding."
 west_african.10.a: "This is simply another lie they spread to force their faith upon us."
 west_african.10.b: "We have different names for many other things, so why not gods?"
 west_african.11.t: "Tradition or Haram?"
 west_african.11.d: "Bringing the word of the Prophet to the people of [Root.GetName] has not been impossible, but the outcome so far has troubled some of our religious scholars. Although they have abadoned many pagan traditions, a reverence for ancestors remains with troubling undertones of worship. We see no fault in honoring one's family, but when prayers are directed to the dead and not to God, can anything good really come of it? Nevertheless, these are ancient practices. Rejecting them may alienate many of those who would otherwise listen."
 west_african.11.a: "We will respect their practices as equal to our own."
 west_african.11.b: "There is no God but God. If they will not learn this, we have achieved nothing."
 west_african.12.t: "Many Spirits, One God"
 west_african.12.d: "We have known of the Muslim faith for a long time, but chosen to remain true to our traditions. Those who devote themselves only to the distant creator, forsaking the gods and spirits that dwell among us, are certainly on the path to misfortune.\n\nPeople at the border, who live next to Muslims every day, have started to see things differently. They find that the words of Muhammad speak to them as well as their neighbors and rather than seeing this as a betrayal of the old ways, they identify the prophet's God with our most revered sky deity."
 west_african.12.a: "Your ancestors go forgotten while you pray to the sky. This is unacceptable."
 west_african.12.b: "Perhaps if we accept their one God, they will consider our many."
 west_african.13.t: "No Compromises in Faith"
 west_african.13.d: "Although many of our citizens are not yet followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have remained hopeful and patient. Others are not so patient. Many of our citizens consider it absurd that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], ruling by the grace of God, accepts the widespread paganism in our country. This, in turn, has sparked concern among the very same pagans that they are subjects of an externally imposed belief system, with some of them calling for the overthrow of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does not show reverence for the spiritual practices that have lived with the people here for millennia."
 west_african.13.a: "The believers are right. We will not tolerate this godlessness."
 west_african.13.b: "The animists, although misguided, must be respected as citizens."
 west_african.13.c: "Let them resolve the matter amongst themselves."
 west_african.13.e: "There is time yet for reconciliation."
 west_african.14.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Scholars"
 west_african.14.d: "Although cut off from many of our faith, we have not forsaken Islamic scholarship. $THEOLOGIAN$ is just one of many who have written great works on the subject, their work inspiring countless others. Through our dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the theological works of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has made it a famous city."
 west_african.14.a: "It shall remain a beacon of wisdom throughout the ages."
 west_african.15.t: "The Flora of [Root.GetName]"
 west_african.15.d: "The scholars and scientists among the [Root.GetAdjective] have been distinguished by extraordinary innovation and curiosity. Their latest efforts have focused on gathering information about the plant life of the large jungle areas of our land, hoping to gain useful information to aid in researching medicine and dyeing techniques. This has been successful so far, with the botany project rippling developments into other areas of research."
 west_african.15.a: "And much is yet to be discovered."
 west_african.16.t: "The Weapons of our Neighbors"
 west_african.16.d: "Although we do not doubt the strength and tenacity of our [Root.GetAdjective] warriors, the technological advances of the neighboring armies have not passed by without our notice. The adoption of firearms greatly changes warfare, and we can see clear advantages in this.\n\nOur neighbors are unlikely to provide us with all the technical details to fully equip our army, but they do seem willing to sell us some of their weapons. While this would probably give them an advantage in terms of our trade exchanges, it would doubtlessly be of use to our military efforts."
 west_african.16.a: "We must acquire this equipment at any cost."
 west_african.16.b: "Our army serves its purpose, with or without these weapons."
 west_african.17.t: "Transatlantic Slave Trade"
 west_african.17.d: "[Root.GetName] is far from the only country keeping slaves, with this being a common fate for war captives in the area. Our European neighbors seem to have especially interested in this lately, seemingly being in desperate need for servants to work the new land they have seized across the ocean. To this end, they are now attempting to arrange a long-term trade agreement with us that will facilitate this purchase of slaves.\n\nWhile we stand to earn money from this, the implications have been the cause of some concern. They apparently consider our people, or at least our captives, to be suitable as their slaves and treat them with unbounded brutality. We don't wish to humor this notion, but there is no telling what they might end up doing if we refuse."
 west_african.17.a: "None will be sold to these people if we can help it."
 west_african.17.b: "If they can pay, we can provide."
 west_african.17.c: "It's time to put an end to the practice of slavery, for us as well as for them."
 west_african.18.t: "Once Nomads"
 west_african.18.d: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people of [Root.GetName] have traditionally lived, at least in part, a nomadic life. Although our efforts to centralize have made this less feasible, people are used to it and expect us not to intervene. It does make [Root.Owner.GetName] more difficult to manage, however. Some of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors have suggested that we try to take control and restrict their movements, but this could be seen as trampling the way of life that made them successful in the first place."
 west_african.18.a: "Let them live as they always did."
 west_african.18.b: "[Root.GetName] is unruly enough as it is."
 west_african.19.t: "The Ashanti"
 west_african.19.d: "The Akan people of Kumasi and the surrounding region have lived there for a long time now, although we have not considered them a nation in their own right. However, their tribe is of such importance to our present affairs that we need to conduct trade and diplomacy with them. Although the nature of the Akan state may yet change, we cannot question its existence."
 west_african.19.a: "Who knows, one day they may become grow to the strength of an empire."
 west_african.20.t: "Sika 'dwa##CHAR_DETECT## The Golden Stool"
 west_african.20.d: "The Ashanti have neighbored one of colonies for some time, so far without any major diplomatic incidents. This all changed recently, when our governor $COLONIALGOVERNOR$, our representative at the Gold Coast, heard of the Golden Stool. This mysterious old artifact apparently holds great significance to the Ashanti, to whom it is the seat of the king. Although we have been vaguely aware of its existence before, it recently came to the knowledge of $COLONIALGOVERNOR$, who demands to sit on it as a demonstration of his, and by extension our, paramount power in the area. \n\n'Why am I not sitting on the Golden Stool at this moment?' he has asked the Ashanti, who have so far shown no sign of complying. Indeed, they seem highly insulted by the suggestion alone. How far should we be willing to pursue this?"
 west_african.20.a: "As far as it takes!"
 west_african.20.a.tt: "The Ashanti may not take kindly to this."
 west_african.20.b: "We have no use for a man who demands such means to assert his dominance."
 west_african.21.t: "War of the Golden Stool"
 west_african.21.d: "The Golden Stool is the symbol of the Ashanti king, which no one is allowed to violate. Now, the [From.GetAdjective], who we trusted had some respect for our traditions despite their disinterest in them, have sent a governor here who demands to sit upon the Stool as if he was king himself. This has outraged the Queen Mother and many others, who are arguing that this man must be stopped and the sanctity of the Golden Stool preserved, at the cost of war if necessary."
 west_african.21.a: "If [From.GetName] trusts such a fool to represent them, there can only be war."
 west_african.21.b: "Traditions are not worth starting a war over."
 west_african.22.t: "Self-rule for the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 west_african.22.d: "The [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] rule [Root.Owner.GetName] justly, we believe. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has been fair to the different tribes under our rule, but to some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects, this is not enough. The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have sent a representative from [Root.GetName], requesting greater rights to make decisions about their own tribes if they are to remain under the reign of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. Although seemingly a humble request, the news of discontent in their home provinces makes it sound more like a demand."
 west_african.22.a: "The tribes are best ruled that rule themselves."
 west_african.22.b: "We don't give into demands, even if veiled."
 west_african.23.t: "Raids Through the Jungle"
 west_african.23.d: "Ever since our adoption of cavalry, the mounted warriors of [Root.GetName] have been feared by all for their uncanny ability to rapidly attack deep inside enemy territory, raiding and weakening the defenses. A group of soldiers have prepared a plan to aid the ongoing war based on this tactic, preparing to break off from the main army and perform the attack in secret, before the enemy can react. Although a risky plan, it could yield much-needed funds for the war."
 west_african.23.a: "We need more plans like these!"
 west_african.23.b: "Bring me those who planned this and let them aid our greater schemes instead."
 west_african.24.t: "Into the Unknown"
 west_african.24.d: "The uncharted territory within and beyond the jungles at our border may seem threatening to many other people. But our tribe has lived in lands like these for a long time, and would never have thrived if we feared exploring the unknown. Now, a large group of young hunters are asking for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s permission to explore and settle in whatever place they may discover. Certainly, these are capable people who could get a lot done if they didn't waste time on dreams of places not yet known, but who are we to put a stop to youthful curiosity?"
 west_african.24.a: "Go and claim what you find for [Root.GetName]!"
 west_african.24.b: "We are the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they are needed here."
 west_african.25.t: "New Dyes"
 west_african.25.d: "Our research into the plant life of [Root.GetName] continues to lead to new discoveries. We have recently uncovered a new way to create dyes, which is both efficient and results in impressive colors not found anywhere else that we know of. Since dyes is one of the important [Root.GetAdjective] exports, we will see that these valuable techniques are spread quickly throughout our land."
 west_african.25.a: "We are dyeing to try them out!"
 west_african.26.t: "The Spirits Remain"
 west_african.26.d: "Many foreign religions have attempted to set their roots among us and many missionaries have tried to turn us towards a God, always the one God, always the same, always different, always theirs. But despite the trying times we have gone through, we keep honoring the spirits and our ancestors. Now the elders have told us that the time is right for a larger celebration of these ancient rites and that people throughout [Root.GetName] should be encouraged to participate.\n\nWith the very people who would see us converted right across the border, this sort of nationwide event would probably attract some irritation from those who consider themselves above it. Our diplomats are suggesting we keep it at a smaller scale, so as to not offend our neighbors."
 west_african.26.a: "Our ancestors did not cower in shame, and neither do we!"
 west_african.26.b: "We can't afford to anger those who have forgotten the truth."
 west_african.27.t: "Immortal [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 west_african.27.d: "[Root.GetName] is a country with many skilled artisans and craftsmen. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is often expected to commission a work of art to commemorate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessor, a tradition which aids both remembering our ancestors and demonstrating the wealth and influence of the current ruler.\n\nMany materials are available, with bronze being the traditional choice. We should pick something suitable for both the grandeur of the previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and affordable for [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 west_african.27.a: "Our sculptors can do miracles with terracotta."
 west_african.27.b: "Bronzework is suitable for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 west_african.27.c: "If we can get the ivory needed, it could be a work for the ages."
 west_african.27.e: "Nothing less than gold will do."
 west_african.27.f: "We cannot afford such frivolities."
 west_african.28.t: "Guns of the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 west_african.28.d: "While our efforts to adopt certain technologies from Europe have been somewhat impeded by the ongoing war, applying our new weapons in the field has had a positive impact. Our soldiers have turned out to be very capable with firearms, and people in the army who have been skeptical to our efforts are now much more positive. Although we are a long way from fully equipping our soldiers with guns, we have taken significant steps along the way."
 west_african.28.a: "[Root.GetAdjective] warriors are already feared today. They will be unstoppable tomorrow."

 flavor_vij.13.d: "The autonomous nature of our Tamil possessions has been the perfect environment to build a power base for a local strongman.\nThe man in question, known as Chellappa, has requested to be allowed to serve as a general and seems content to act within the internal structure of our empire. It is, however, generally assumed that a man as ambitious as him must have his eyes set on much higher goals than a position in the army. While it is easy to deny him the honor he seeks and try to isolate him politically we run the risk of distancing ourselves of someone in control over much of our economic heartland.\nOn the other hand perhaps it would be most prudent to strike at him now instead of prolonging a conflict that many feel will be inevitable."
 flavor_vij.13.a: "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer"
 flavor_vij.13.b: "Try to limit his influence to his Tamil power base."
 flavor_vij.13.c: "Strike now to crush him before he grows too strong."
 flavor_vij.14.t: "Revolt of Chellappa"

 flavor_vij.14.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_vij.15.t: "Revolt of Chellappa"
 flavor_vij.15.d: "The chiefs of the Tamil lands have been duped to believe that they would be better off in a state of their own rather than as a part of our empire. Local strongman Chellappa Saluva has raised an army and is attempting to carve out a state of his own over the area already de facto under his control."
 flavor_vij.15.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_vij.16.t: "Chellappa Marginalized"

 flavor_vij.17.t: "Pulicat"
 flavor_vij.17.d: "The Northern Coromandel coast and the city of Pulicat in particular is vital to our empire. It is through this coastal strip that all of the goods of the east reaches the demanding 500 000 souls in our imperial capital.\nAs the area recovers from the Orissan occupation, and as the capital of Vijayanagar itself keeps growing, the port now seems to have entered a golden age of economic growth and prosperity."
 flavor_vij.17.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_vij.18.t: "Tirupati-Tirumala Temple Complex"
 flavor_vij.18.d: "Perhaps the greatest temple of all in our lands, the great temple of Venkateshwara and the connected temple city of Tirupati has increasingly come to be connected with the rulers of our state. Over the years it has grown from a major pilgrimage to one of the great temple cities in India. The city is supported by the donations of countless treasures as well as over 40 villages providing it with food and income.\nWe should, however, not be content with this. By increasing our support, providing it with even more villages and donations, we could ensure that it becomes the greatest temple city in all of Southern India. May Tirupati prosper for as long as our empire grows!"
 flavor_vij.18.a: "Donate lavishly."
 flavor_vij.18.b: "Let us keep our contributions more modest."
 flavor_vij.19.t: "Abd-ur-Razzaq, ambassador of the Timurid court"
 flavor_vij.19.d: "An ambassador of Shah Rukh in faraway Samarkand arrived today in our capital. While the Timurid had traveled far and seen many great things on his way to our great city he appeared very impressed by what he found here. His knowledge of the world outside of India as well as the observations he could share regarding the lands of our direct neighbors will be very useful to us."
 flavor_vij.19.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_vij.20.t: "The Chalukya Imperial Capital"
 flavor_vij.20.d: "Though they are long gone, the Chalukya Empire which stretched from the Deccan to the Tamil kingdoms remains a powerful memory. As our own empire has expanded and advanced, the poets and chroniclers write as though Vijayanagar were the Chalukya Empire reborn. Now that we have seized the ancient Chakulya capital of Kalyana, located not far from the former Bahmani capital of Bidar, we have an opportunity to relocate the court to the northern city so that we can fully claim the Chalukya legacy as our own.\n\nThe traditional capital at Vijayangar, The City of Victory, yet remains a great and prestigious city however, and allows us to forge an imperial legacy of our own."
 flavor_vij.20.a: "The City of Victory will remain our capital."
 flavor_vij.20.b: "We will claim the Chalukya legacy, move the capital to Kalyana!"
 flavor_vij.20.c: "Leave the capital in its present location."
 flavor_vij.21.t: "The City of Victory"
 flavor_vij.21.d: "The Vijayangar Empire stands victorious over all of its enemies; the upstart Bahmani Sultanate is utterly defeated, the Tamil kings dutifully accept our rule, and we have even added Andhra and Lanka to our domain. Feasts and festivals in the capital celebrate the moment of our victory in south India as the Maharaja confers upon [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] the title of Chhatrapati in a clear message to the world that Vijayanagar will submit to no foreign power."

 flavor_mor.1.t: "Crisis of the Maghreb"
 flavor_mor.1.d: "The last century has been a harsh and unforgiving one for the countries of the Maghreb. Due to increasing desertification, shrinking urban population, general famine and increasingly strong groups disloyal of nomads roaming the countryside most of the states in North Africa have seen better days.\nWhile things are looking up a bit lately, internal trade is on the rise and there are signs of increasing urbanization again, our states are still shadows of their former selves. Many fear that once the Iberians have finished off the Kingdom of Granada they will be coming for us."

Large numbers of Andalusian Moorish refugees have therefore been arriving in our ports, asking to be let into our country. While it pains us that these of people had to leave their homes this may well be a blessing for our kingdom. Most of the refugees are city dwellers, craftsmen, scholars, artists and administrators.

With him from the holy land al-Jazuli brings the Dala'il al-Khayrat, a prayer book in which he has collected litanies asking God to bless, show mercy and kindness to Muhammed.\nUnlike al-Jazuli himself the book can be in many places and given its fantastic popularity it seems destined to survive both him and our dynasty."

There is, however, always a risk with passionate popular movements like this one, it wouldn't do for them to forget who wields the temporal power."

 flavor_mor.5.t: "Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi"
 flavor_mor.5.d: "In all but name Morocco has not one but two royal dynasties. Since twenty years past almost all power formally held by the Marinid dynasty has in fact been wielded by their formidable Wattasid vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya.\nInsanely popular after his victory over the Portuguese in 1437 and his patronization of the Idrisid cult in Fez, Abu Zakariya Yahya has ensured that the royal bureaucracy is both well functioning and imbued with Wattasid family members. As the Wattasids are related to the Marinid rulers this is in itself perhaps not a worrying development. Now that Abu Zakariya Yahya lies on his deathbed, however, we cannot but wonder what the future will bring. The great man has seemingly left nothing to chance and has already arranged for his cousin to succeed him as Vizier but what remains unclear is what the Wattasid family will do in the future with the network Yahya has built them."

The popularity of the Wattasid family, however, means that this has been a very unpopular move.\nAs $MONARCH$ appointed a new, non Wattasid, vizier to serve him yesterday riots broke out and it is rumored that somewhere two Wattasid brothers remain hidden to take control over this revolt, determined to avenge their family."

Under the Idrisids and Marinids, the northern city of Fez has been the favored seat of government, allowing its rulers to lead the charge against their enemies in Iberia and the eastern Maghreb. The Almavorids and Almohads favored the southern city of Marrakech, while Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur attempted to establish the capital at Rabat. Some in the court argue that Meknes could also serve as a political center. Any of these cities would make a fine capital for our nation."

Migrating south the Fulani have now formed an expansionist state around Futa Tooro with its eyes set on the entire Senegambian region. These Fulani seem to have no respect for our borders and there have been numerous incidents already of these tribesmen penetrating deep into our lands, levying taxes on our people and undermining our authority."
 flavor_mal.2.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_mal.4.t: "The Wangara and the Portuguese"
 flavor_mal.4.d: "Having adopted a less violent approach, Portuguese traders have become an increasingly common sight along our western coasts. In many ways this is a boon to our state as it has given us much easier access to horses for our armies and a way to procure valuable goods from the many exotic ports frequented by Portuguese merchants. For gold or slaves there is not much the Portuguese wouldn't sell us and our merchant caste, the Wangara, is thriving due to this new partnership.\nThere is, however, a slight worry about this development in some camps, the amount of slaves to a horse seem to keep increasing by the day and while our own transoceanic ventures haven't gone so well it would seem less than prudent to rely entirely on these foreign merchants as they surely can't have our best interests at heart."
 flavor_mal.4.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_mal.5.t: "Portuguese Meddling"
 flavor_mal.5.d: "The Portuguese traders on our western coast have become quite a nuisance lately. While the horses they bring for our armies and the exotic goods they bring from far away countries are of great use to us it seems they cannot help but meddle in the local politics. It is clear that several chiefs that are in contact with the Portuguese have been encouraged to extend their personal authority and to slowly attempt to cut the ties with our central administration.\nIn order to deal with this we could either strike at the chiefs themselves or attempt to limit the influence of the Portuguese."

Islam has, however, been gaining more ground lately among the aristocracy and wandering marabouts have also become an increasingly common sight even in the farthest corners of our lands.\nIn the past our predecessors have all avoided trying to be too forceful about converting their subjects but if we wish we could probably make use of these recent developments to encourage the spread of the true faith."

He has now threatened to sever the ties with us completely and has started to deal with the European trading nations directly rather than as our representative. Never very committed to the Malian state religion Kaabu has grown to be a stronghold of the local traditional religion and its new rulers have been quick to use this against us.\nWith a strong religious identity and its Atlantic trade ties Kaabu has every chance of becoming a durable state. If we are to stop this we should probably act as soon as possible."

Instead the royal court travels from chief to chief every few months.\nWhile it is hard to establish an administrative continuity under such circumstances the traveling court does have its benefits. The frequent visits of the royal courts in all corners of the Empire are contributing to the growth of a common elite culture in our lands."
 flavor_eth.7.a: "This is how it has always been."
 flavor_eth.7.b: "Actively encourage the cultural conversion of the countryside."
 flavor_eth.8.t: "Debre Berhan - The Mountain of Light"
 flavor_eth.8.d: "$MONARCH$ has had a vision in which he has been shown a shining mountain on which to build the new capital of Ethiopia. A church has already been constructed at the site and now it is up to the state to realize the dream of our Emperor."
 flavor_eth.8.a: "The time has come for a permanent Capital."
 flavor_eth.8.b: "Let us not break with Tradition."
 flavor_eth.9.t: "Debre Berhan Plundered"
 flavor_eth.9.d: "Old traditions die hard and as the countryside of Debre Berhan is being plundered the new capital is being abandoned by everyone from our courtiers to the lowliest stable boy. We have no choice but to resume the custom of having an itinerant court."
 flavor_eth.9.a: "We must move to the provinces."
 flavor_eth.10.t: "Gondar - A new Capital"
 flavor_eth.10.d: "$MONARCH$ finds himself spending more and more time by the monasteries at lake Tana. Due to this continued patronage of the king a small market town has begun to spring up in the area and some have started to name the city as a secondary capital of our kingdom.\nThis idea has grown on $MONARCH$ who believes a permanent capital here might allow us to start a new spiritual and architectural legacy."
 flavor_eth.10.a: "Let us build our capital here."
 flavor_eth.10.b: "We must not bind ourselves to one place."
 flavor_eth.11.t: "The fate of the Egyptian Copts"
 flavor_eth.11.d: "Word has reached us from Egypt that the Mameluk sultan is persecuting the Copts in his lands. As a fellow kingdom under the Patriarchate of Alexandria it is our duty to act. The fact that the patriarch himself is in Mameluk hands complicates things somewhat however, a direct attack might place the foundation of our church at risk."
 flavor_eth.11.a: "Send a strongly worded letter to the Sultan."
 flavor_eth.11.b: "Avoid the risk of angering the Mamluks."
 flavor_eth.11.c: "This is cause for war!"
 flavor_eth.12.t: "A letter arrives from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.12.d: "We have received a letter from the Ethiopian Emperor today. The message is a detailed account of the many perceived misdeeds of our Sultanate against the Copts that reside within our borders.\nThere is likely little reason for concern, however, as the patriarch of both the Egyptian and Ethiopian Copts is our hostage. It seems very unlikely that an Ethiopian monarch would risk the safety of his patriarch over a matter such as this."
 flavor_eth.12.a: "Send a sarcastic reply."
 flavor_eth.12.b: "Attempt to apologize and repair relations."
 flavor_eth.13.t: "A letter has arrived from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.13.d: "We have received word that the Emperor of Ethiopia feels we are mistreating the Coptic population in our lands. He clearly sees this as a cause for war and there is much speculation that an Ethiopian attack might be imminent."
 flavor_eth.13.a: "They wouldn't dare."
 flavor_eth.14.t: "An ambassador from the Mameluks"
 flavor_eth.14.d: "Today a Mameluk messenger arrived at our court bearing the reply of the Sultan to our concerns about the Copts in his lands.\nThe reply is far from the apology we had expected however. The Sultan has chosen to show his contempt for the Ethiopian court and he ridicules any form of retribution that we might attempt."
 flavor_eth.14.a: "Imprison the Ambassador."
 flavor_eth.14.b: "This is cause for war!"
 flavor_eth.14.c: "Let's just drop it."
 flavor_eth.15.t: "Mameluks Apologize"
 flavor_eth.15.d: "The Mameluk Sultan has sent word that he is looking into the situation of Copts in his lands. He assures us that he has nothing but feelings of friendship towards the Ethiopian people and the Coptic church."
 flavor_eth.15.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_eth.16.t: "Ambassador Detained"
 flavor_eth.16.d: "The Ethiopian emperor was so displeased by our reply to his letter that he had our messenger detained."
 flavor_eth.16.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_eth.17.t: "Death of a Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.d: "The Bishop of Ethiopia has died and the Ethiopian church has requested a successor from the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria.\nWhile a successor has been chosen by the Patriarch this would be a good opportunity to show the Ethiopians who is in charge. The Emperor of Ethiopia has actively pursued a policy of conversion against his Muslim subjects and he still detains the ambassador we sent to chastise him last time."
 flavor_eth.17.a: "Prevent the appointment of a new Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.b: "We must not interfere in these matters"
 flavor_eth.18.t: "Bishop missing"
 flavor_eth.18.d: "It has been a long while now since the last bishop of Ethiopia died and we requested a successor from Alexandria. Could the Mamluks be interfering?"
 flavor_eth.18.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_eth.19.t: "The Monastic Orders"
 flavor_eth.19.d: "One of the greatest strengths of the Ethiopian church is the great number of successful monasteries that dot the landscape of our state. The Monastic orders have contributed to the success of our state by founding new monasteries in newly conquered areas and by spreading the word of the true faith there. The monasteries of Ethiopia are also the source of the education of the Ethiopian clergy, its nobility and its administrators and as such have contributed greatly to the revitalization of the Ethiopian church in the years past.\nThe other side of this coin, however, is that the monasteries and the orders that run them have grown both rich and autonomous."
 flavor_eth.19.a: "Attempt to rein them in."
 flavor_eth.19.b: "Safeguard the privileges of the orders"
 flavor_eth.20.t: "Independence from the Patriarchate"
 flavor_eth.20.d: "The dependency of the Ethiopian church on the Patriarchate of Alexandria has always been a liability for our country. Perhaps there was once a practical need of bishops, clergy and spiritual guidance from abroad. The expansion of the Ethiopian church over the last two centuries, however, means that our kingdom is now already training its own clergymen and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout or lands.\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by Muslim conquerors we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next. It would be far more efficient to appoint our religious leadership from the ranks of our own clergy."
 flavor_eth.20.a: "We cannot dishonor our Patriarch."
 flavor_eth.20.b: "Our Church should be free of foreign influence."
 flavor_eth.21.t: "The Oromo"
 flavor_eth.21.d: "A strange nomadic people have crossed our border from the African interior into our borderlands. Migrating in large numbers protected by very able warriors, their alien customs threaten to rip apart and reshape the very fabric of society here.\nThese disciples of Waaq are quickly displacing and converting the followers of the all faiths in the area, replacing old social structures with new ones of their own."
 flavor_eth.21.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_eth.23.t: "Oromo Settlers"
 flavor_eth.23.d: "Groups of nomadic settlers have entered the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The province population is being either displaced or assimilated by the Oromo."
 flavor_eth.23.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_eth.24.t: "Integration of the Oromo"
 flavor_eth.24.d: "It seems the waves of Oromo settlers moving into our lands have finally faltered. The immigrants themselves have also begun to settle down and while our society is changed in many ways the violent initial phase of integration of this new people seem to be over."
 flavor_eth.24.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_eth.26.t: "Amba Geshen - The Mountain of Kings"
 flavor_eth.26.d: "Once, our great kingdom was plagued by crisis and civil strife upon every succession. In order to deal with this problem one of the first of the Solomonic kings therefore set up the institution of Mount Geshen. Ever since that day all royal princes except the direct heir of the king are kept isolated from the outside world on the slopes of Mount Geshen. The state ensures that these potential kings lack for nothing and this time of isolation may be used for study and contemplation by the princes. In order to protect the princes from the outside world, and in order to protect the kingdom from the claims of the princes, the mountain is kept under close guard.\nThis custom has served us well over the years and the kingdom has become much more stable than it once was. Still some feel that keeping all of our royal heirs in one place is quite risky.\nToday we find ourselves with an aging king and no heir to succeed, it is precisely in situations like these that the mountain might come in handy."
 flavor_eth.26.a: "We are fortunate that our ancestors had such foresight."
 flavor_eth.26.b: "We have no need for this gilded prison."
 flavor_eth.26.b.tt: "The mountain will be used for other purposes"
 flavor_eth.27.t: "Helen of Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.27.d: "Early on in his reign king $MONARCH$ married the daughter of one of the Muslim chiefs of the kingdom. As the young woman converted and said her vows to the Ethiopian emperor there was no way to know that this would turn out to be one of the most influential persons in Ethiopian politics for years to come. Eleni or Helen would in time serve not only her husband but several successive kings after him as an able advisor and as a power behind the throne."
 flavor_eth.27.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_eth.28.t: "Disaster at the Mountain of Kings"
 flavor_eth.28.d: "Nobody knows exactly what happened but news reached us today that all of the princes on Mount Geshen are dead. It would appear that someone managed to surprise the guards to then proceed to slaughter the royal heirs. As the kingdom tries to recover from the shock it is clear that this particular tradition will no longer be part of our national heritage."
 flavor_eth.28.a: "All is lost."

Less than a generation ago Nur Qutb-i ‘Alam, leader of the Chishti in Bengal ensured our return to power as the Sultanate was threatened by a Hindu usurper.\nAs the sad news of Nur Qutb-i ‘Alam's passing now reach us the time has come to reaffirm this alliance between worldly and spiritual power. On the other hand this might also be a good opportunity to distance the throne from the Chishti order, an organization which has grown a bit too powerful for comfort."

The clearing of land to allow our ever-growing population some room to spread is a process that has been going on slowly but steadily for longer than anyone can remember.\nRecently a number of holy men, many of them Sufis have begun to get involved in this process. These holy men have mobilized the hearts of our people and the process of land reclamation suddenly seems to be going a lot smoother than it ever has before.

On the site of an old fort squarely in the middle of the Deccan plateau an entirely new capital has been built, a magnificent city comparable to the great cities of Persia and Transoxiana. With its 37 bastions and 7 gates Bidar is also an impressive fort and the foremost defense of our dynasty.\nBuilt to impress the royal court itself, it is no less awe-inspiring and the audience hall with the Turquoise throne of our dynasty is perhaps the most renowned symbol of our family.\nNone of this comes cheap of course.

 flavor_guj.5.a: "What a clear sighted man!"
 flavor_guj.6.t: "The Jain and Hindu Merchant Community - Vasanta Vilasa"
 flavor_guj.6.d: "The well being of the merchants of Gujarat has always been close to the heart of our dynasty and we have come to not only tolerate but also in many ways encourage the Jain, Hindu or Parsi traders that do business in our cities.\nAs a result business has been very good for merchants of all religions in Gujarat lately. In a recently completed manuscript about the rites of spring and the god Krishna a prominent Hindu merchant of Ahmadabad has taken the opportunity to praise the city and its rulers.\nPerhaps this more than anything is a sign of the success of our policies."
 flavor_guj.6.a: "Great."
 flavor_guj.6.b: "Blasphemy! Clearly our laws have become too lax."
 flavor_guj.7.t: "An Embassy to the Ottoman Sultan"
 flavor_guj.7.d: "In a dangerous world it is sometimes good to have contacts that can protect you. With the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean it seems uncertain if anyone can be safe at sea anymore. We have received repeated reports of shipping being raided by Christian ships lately. These pirates threaten the trade that our Sultanate lives from and must be stopped.\nIt has recently come to our attention that the Ottoman Empire, distant as it may be, has acquired ports in the red sea. Perhaps it would be wise to contact the Sultan of Constantinople to discuss a possible alliance against these Christian pirates?"
 flavor_guj.7.a: "Send an emissary to the Sublime Porte."
 flavor_guj.7.b: "We will manage fine in our own."
 flavor_guj.8.t: "Time to get involved in the Indian Ocean?"
 flavor_guj.8.d: "An emissary from the far away Gujarati Sultanate arrived at court today. The Sultan of Gujarat sends word that he has been plagued by Portuguese pirates and that these ships are threatening the stream of oriental goods from flowing east into our lands. The Portuguese have also been preventing the Indian faithful from reaching Mecca and Medina, a journey that starts in Gujarat for many.\nGujarat may be far away but we could surely send them something to help them in their struggle."
 flavor_guj.8.a: "We must stand strong with our brothers in faith!"
 flavor_guj.8.b: "India? We have matters to attend to much closer than that."
 flavor_guj.9.t: "Ottoman Aid"
 flavor_guj.9.d: "The Ottoman sultan has sent us word that he sympathies deeply with our wish to be free from the Portuguese threat. In order to help us defend ourselves he has sent a number of ships and Ottoman naval officers, both which might benefit our kingdom in a future struggle against the Portuguese."
 flavor_guj.9.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_guj.10.t: "Dark Tidings"
 flavor_guj.10.d: "Unfortunately it seems the Sultan feels less strongly than we do about a unified front against these Christian pirates and he has sent word that he is not interested in any oriental adventures."
 flavor_guj.10.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_guj.11.t: "Death of Ahmad Kattu"
 flavor_guj.11.d: "Ahmad Kattu, Sufi master and supporter of our family has passed away. This great man has acted as an advisor for more than one generation of Gujarati Sultans and once took part in the planning of the great city of Ahmadabad. This loss leaves a great spiritual void in our kingdom and our dynasty will be forever in his debt."
 flavor_guj.11.a: "We must construct a magnificent mausoleum to honor this great man."
 flavor_guj.11.b: "This is a great loss for the kingdom."
 flavor_guj.12.t: "Qissa-i Sanjan - The Parsee Community of Gujarat"
 flavor_guj.12.d: "Many hundred years ago a group of Zoroastrian refugees from Persia settled down in Gujarat, founding the Parsee community of Sanjan. Through the centuries this religious minority has proved resilient and has taken an active part in the development of this dynamic region.\nRecently a Parsee priest has recorded the oral historical tradition of the Parsees, from their exodus from Persia in the 10th century up to today. The resulting Qissa-i Sanjan is surely a classical example of high class Persian poetry but it is above all a story that will be treasured by the Parsees themselves for generations to come."
 flavor_guj.12.a: "Rozumiem."
 flavor_guj.13.t: "Mirat-i-Sikandiri"
 flavor_guj.13.d: "The Gujarat Sultanate has a rich tradition of historical writing and over the year many court historians have received the patronage of our dynasty. The recently completed Mirat-i-Sikandiri by Shaikh Sikandar ibn Muhammad Manjhu is not only an excellent example of this but also tries to incorporate all previous writings on its subject. The resulting work is a detailed chronicle over the history of the Sultanate of Gujarat from its creation up until today."

 tyw_events.1.t: "Reservatum Ecclesiasticum"
 tyw_events.1.d: "As Emperor, we may have to accept that some of our subjects fall to heresy to avoid internal conflict. The ruler dictates the religion of the realm, after all. We may not afford to be so lenient with ecclesiastical principalities, however. One of the Prince-Bishops who rule in the Holy Roman Empire appears to have abandoned the Church and listened to the lies of the Protestants, risking not only his own soul, but those of all his subjects. Thanks to the ecclesiastical reservation, we reserve the right to force him to resign in the event of betrayal like this."
 tyw_events.1.a: "Enforce it! A good Catholic will take his place."
 tyw_events.1.a.tt: "Send word to the [This.Monarch.GetTitle] of [This.GetName]. We will know his response in two weeks' time."

 tyw_events.2.t: "Emperor Demands Resignation"
 tyw_events.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s conversion to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith appears to have angered Emperor [From.Monarch.GetName]. [From.GetName] is now claiming to enforce the Reservatum Ecclesiasticum, a measure that forces [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s within the Empire to give up their titles if they convert from Catholicism. The reservation is not supported among Protestants in the Empire, and perhaps it would lose some of its authority if genuinely contested."
 tyw_events.2.a: "It's in the Emperor's right."
 tyw_events.2.b: "Never! There is salvation outside the Church!"
 tyw_events.3.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] Refuses Resignation"
 tyw_events.3.d: "To our surprise and outrage, [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has refused to accept the validity of the ecclesiastical reservation as we interpret it, claiming that evoking it is proof of tyranny on our part. If we wish to save the souls of the [From.GetAdjective] people, it appears we have to enforce the true faith ourselves."
 tyw_events.3.a: "The heretics will burn."
 tyw_events.4.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] Resigns"
 tyw_events.4.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has wisely accepted our enforcement of the ecclesiastical reservation and resigned in favor of the Catholic [From.Monarch.GetName]. We have also demonstrated that the Holy Roman Empire stays true to its name and that we expect our religious leaders, if not all princes, remain on the true path or give their title to one who does."
 tyw_events.4.a: "The Emperor protects."
 tyw_events.5.t: "Blokada"
 tyw_events.5.d: "The people of [Root.GetCapitalName] rely heavily on their port to supply the city with what it needs, but the blockade against [Root.GetName] has cut off both many luxuries and some goods they claim are necessary to run the city. The people can hardly make do with [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] alone, and are turning to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to find a solution."
 tyw_events.5.a: "Divert resources to get goods delivered via land routes."

 tyw_events.6.t: "The Great Comet"
 tyw_events.6.d: "Mysterious phenomena on the night sky have often been interpreted as bad omens or signs of the end times. An exceptionally noticeable such phenomenon, a great comet, has been visible recently, causing more of a stir than usual.\n\n$NATURAL_SCIENTIST$, however, has taken the opportunity to closely observe the comet's movements. The result has been a scientific work that tells us much about the object's distance from us and dispels many old superstitions about comets. While it appears uncertain if commoners will remember this in the future, this comet has provided more insight than fear."
 tyw_events.6.a: "Keep looking at the sky!"
 tyw_events.7.t: "Education for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tyw_events.7.d: "The tragic passing of the previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has left [Root.Heir.GetName] without a parent, but not without guardians or tutors. Advisors serving at our court are preoccupied with giving [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] the best education available in preparation of ruling [Root.GetName]. Hoping to gain favor and influence in the future, many people try to serve as a primary influence. Ultimately, one of them is likely to succeed, impacting what sort of ruler [Root.Heir.GetName] will turn out to be."
 tyw_events.7.a: "An advisor working in the administrative division will provide the best education."
 tyw_events.7.a.tt: "[Root.Heir.GetName] will increase [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative skills."
 tyw_events.7.b: "A diplomatic mind is necessary to teach and to rule [Root.GetName]."

 tyw_events.8.t: "Scottish Mercenaries"
 tyw_events.8.d: "Although Scotland has so far managed to stay out of the religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, it is not for lack of interest. We are keenly aware that this war will impact all of Europe and are not without diplomatic stake in the outcome. Although Scotland may not be willing to go to war for a League, many Scots are. Serving as mercenaries in foreign armies on the continent, they may well change the course of the war without our direct involvement."
 tyw_events.8.a: "Send them to fight for the Evangelical League."
 tyw_events.8.b: "Send them to fight for the Catholic League."
 tyw_events.8.c: "We need all the troops we can muster right here."
 tyw_events.9.t: "Scottish Mercenaries"
 tyw_events.9.d: "Mercenaries from Scotland have begun to join our ranks in large numbers. Reports indicate that our allies are also seeing many of them arriving to join the righteous in our efforts to finish the religious struggles in the Holy Roman Empire once and for all. Although their nation is not joining us in the war, the Scots appear to be willing to fight for our League, for the right price."
 tyw_events.9.a: "Then we shall be willing to pay it."
 tyw_events.10.t: "Hungarians Revolt Against Habsburg Rule"
 tyw_events.10.d: "The Hungarian people of [Root.GetName] have begun to see the religious conflict in the Empire as one between them and the Habsburgs who rule [Root.Owner.GetName]. When war rages between Protestant and Catholic kings and emperors, they claim that the people must take up arms to protect their faith as well. As if the ongoing war was not enough, we must now grapple with these troublemakers in lands that should long since have accepted being ruled by the Habsburg dynasty."
 tyw_events.10.a: "Our enemies spread lies everywhere."
 tyw_events.11.t: "Huguenots Gather in La Rochelle"
 tyw_events.11.d: "The wars of religion may be over, but the religious conflicts in France are not. The Huguenot heretics, claiming to be concerned about their right to practice their faith under the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName], have started to prepare for what might very well be open revolt. Although they have not gone that far yet, they have gathered in the city of La Rochelle and started to fortify its defensive structures. Their exact intentions are not clear, but the more rebellious among them claim that they will create an independent state, breaking free from French and Catholic rule."
 tyw_events.11.a: "If this continues, we may just turn out to be as ruthless as they claim us to be."
 tyw_events.12.t: "Huguenot Rebels Need Our Help"
 tyw_events.12.d: "Although [Root.GetName] is now free from the tyranny of the Catholic Church, many suffer the same oppression abroad. The Huguenots in France have found it necessary to build fortifications in preparation of the terrors the French regime no doubt are willing to visit upon them.\n\nAs true as the faith of these brave people might be, it is doubtful if they have the means to resist the power of the French army. However, with the backing of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], anything is possible."
 tyw_events.12.a: "Tell them to strike against the French, and we will follow!"
 tyw_events.12.b: "We would rather not draw the wrath of France."
 tyw_events.13.t: "British Support for Huguenots"
 tyw_events.13.d: "The Huguenot dissidents who gathered in La Rochelle, previously showing at least some caution, have been emboldened by the support of the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle]. Apparently the treacherous heretics in [From.GetName] have seen it fit not only to spread their lies to France, but to spark fires here as well. Whether or not they will honor their promise, the Huguenots are now in open revolt."
 tyw_events.13.a: "Enemies of France will pay for this, in La Rochelle as well as in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 tyw_events.14.t: "Fall of Prague"
 tyw_events.14.d: "Prague has been home to many kings and even emperors and is a city with many legacies within it. With today's capture by [Root.GetAdjective] troops, there is certainly a temptation to bring some of the city's treasures back to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and claim them for our own. With some rare artifacts being peerless in the known world, this may be our only chance to get our hands on them... but hardly without drawing the anger of Prague's citizens."
 tyw_events.14.a: "Bring these to our capital! That is how legacies are built."
 tyw_events.14.b: "These treasures belong here."
 tyw_events.15.t: "Albrecht von Wallenstein"
 tyw_events.15.d: "A noble of the House of Waldstein has emerged as a talented general amidst the religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire. Hailing from Bohemia, Wallenstein proved his loyalty to the emperor early in the war. He has already begun to provide insights and innovation both on the larger and smaller scale of warfare and will, we hope, continue to be a valuable asset in our efforts to restore faith and order to the Empire."
 tyw_events.15.a: "Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] needs loyalty now more than ever."
 tyw_events.16.t: "Wallenstein's Loyalties Doubted"
 tyw_events.16.d: "Since joining our forces early in the war, Wallenstein has shown himself to be very capable as a military commander. However, although he has made an effort to appear loyal and grateful, he is known to disagree with many of Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decisions. Reliable sources indicate that he has even been angered by some of our refusals to compromise in the conflict. Many now suspect him of considering defecting to the enemy. Fortunately, some of the officers in his forces are still loyal to us first. They could ensure he never fights for another League."
 tyw_events.16.a: "He needs to be captured, alive or dead."
 tyw_events.16.b: "We need him alive, leading out troops."
 tyw_events.17.t: "Wallenstein Betrays Us"
 tyw_events.17.d: "The worst fears of our advisors have proven true. Our dependence on Wallenstein's military leadership while the war put increased strain on our nation and Empire made him bold enough to desert us in the midst of the war, fleeing to join the enemy. Our troops have not seen the last of him on the battlefields, but he will now be leading the armies of the traitors against the Emperor."
 tyw_events.17.a: "We should have had him killed while we had the chance."
 tyw_events.17.a.tt: "Albrecht von Wallenstein will defect to [This.GetName]."
 tyw_events.18.t: "General Wallenstein Defects from [From.GetName]"
 tyw_events.18.d: "Our war to stop the [From.Religion.GetName] tyranny of the Holy Roman Emperor in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has made even [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own generals doubt their cause. After seeing [From.GetName]'s refusal to compromise as the war drags on, Albrecht von Wallenstein has decided that he would be better off serving us. It appears they doubted his loyalties one time too many."
 tyw_events.18.a: "A self-fulfilling prophecy, but fortunate for us."
 tyw_events.19.t: "Winter Siege"
 tyw_events.19.d: "A siege dragging on over winter is always costly and best avoided completely. This winter has been particularly harsh and one of our sieges has seen both equipment and soldiers freezing. At this rate, we'll either have to recuperate and wait out the winter or send in more men, many of whom are likely to die from cold and starvation. How many are we willing to sacrifice to take this one city?"
 tyw_events.19.a: "As many as it takes."
 tyw_events.19.b: "Let us bide our time."
 tyw_events.20.t: "End of the House of Griffins"
 tyw_events.20.d: "The tumultuous state of the Holy Roman Empire has taken a toll on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s health. Our small nation lies in the midst of a brewing conflict, and at the worst possible time, our ruler is in poor health and lacks heirs. With [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] passing, Pomerania sees the end of the Griffins, who have ruled this nation for centuries, and risks partition by the powers who are opportunistically striking against the weakest parts of the Empire."
 tyw_events.20.a: "We will persist as sovereign through these hard times."
 tyw_events.20.a.tt: "[This.GetName] will gain claims on all Pomeranian provinces."
 tyw_events.21.t: "End of the House of Griffins"
 tyw_events.21.d: "After ruling Pomerania for centuries, the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the House of Griffins to reign in the country has passed away without an heir. With the ongoing religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, it would not be impossible for someone with ambition to lay claim to the region. However, we are not the only ones who have noticed this, and many powers may soon prepare to get their share to Pomeranian lands."
 tyw_events.21.a: "We know an opportunity when we see one."
 tyw_events.22.t: "Battle of [Root.GetCapitalName]"
 tyw_events.22.d: "The League war has been brought to the heart of our nation, and yet we have suffered defeat. [From.GetAdjective] forces engaged ours near our capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and won, which has caused both concern and shame in our military. The war may be won yet, but this battle may still be remembered, whether we like it or not."
 tyw_events.22.a: "We can only hope our future successes will overshadow it."
 tyw_events.23.t: "Enemies of the League"
 tyw_events.23.d: "Our decision to take a stance in the religious conflict in the Holy Roman Empire has caused even more heated discussions about where [Root.GetName] stands on the issue of the Reformation. We may not doubt the goals of the League, but there is no shortage of people in our country who do. What is obvious to us, that we have chosen the right side for the good of all [Root.GetAdjective] people regardless of faith, seems like the lies of heretics to some of our subjects. The most zealous objectors have taken up arms against their rulers and the League."
 tyw_events.23.a: "How little these people know of international affairs."
 tyw_events.24.t: "$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ Questions Our Faith"
 tyw_events.24.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is a practically minded ruler. Although as pious as any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], politically expedient alliances come first, and despite our [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have joined a religious League that opposes our beliefs. Most advisors see this as a necessity - some of them may even have suggested it.\n\n$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ is not such an advisor. A person of faith, they have hid their outrage at our decision poorly and their attitude is now beginning to impact our international diplomacy. Although we remain loyal to the League, we may find it difficult to retain good relations with its members when we are not only of the wrong faith, but keep such company."
 tyw_events.24.a: "If they can't keep their mouth shut, they must go."
 tyw_events.24.b: "Our allies deserve to hear the truth, even when they don't like it."
 tyw_events.25.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Culture.GetName] Question our Rule"
 tyw_events.25.d: "The people of [Root.GetName] have often seen their loyalty to [Root.Owner.GetName] questioned both because of their [Root.Culture.GetName] heritage and because of their refusal to follow the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith. This has led some of them to question whether they belong under the rule of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] at all. Increasingly, they are requesting the right for locals who represent their interests to make decisions on how the province should be ruled. We are reaching a point where some kind of compromise has to be made."
 tyw_events.25.a: "Give power to the [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] nobles in the region."
 tyw_events.25.b: "Give power to those [Root.Culture.GetName] who follow the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith."
 tyw_events.25.c: "Agree to give them the right to rule themselves to some extent."
 tyw_events.26.t: "Jesuit Education for [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tyw_events.26.d: "The Society of Jesus, a congregation more commonly known as by the name of its members, the Jesuits, have offered to provide an education for young [Root.Heir.GetName]. Many relatives and advisors have supported the suggestion, hoping that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will grow up to become, as the Jesuits call themselves, a soldier of God. In these turbulent times, they argue, strength of the spirit is the most important trait of a ruler. Others fear that a people so close to the Church would harden the nascent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s heart to those who stray from its doctrine."
 tyw_events.26.a: "We need a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who can fight for our faith!"
 tyw_events.26.a.tt: "[Root.Heir.GetName] will be raised as a soldier of God, versed in military matters, but harsh on heretics."
 tyw_events.26.b: "We will not allow a religious order to influence our future ruler."
 tyw_events.27.t: "Jesuit-Educated [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Ascends to the Throne"
 tyw_events.27.d: "Leaving [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s education to the Jesuits has yielded what most would consider the expected results. The new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not lack conviction or bravery, but is fiercely loyal to the Catholic Church and the Jesuits in particular. The faithful rejoice, but heretics now fear [Root.GetName] more than ever."
 tyw_events.27.a: "Ad maiorem Dei gloriam."
 tyw_events.28.t: "[Root.Culture.GetName] Nobles Flee Abroad"
 tyw_events.28.d: "The war for religious unity in the Holy Roman Empire is not going our way. Our capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], by many considered the last safe refuge for those who can make it there, has been taken by the enemy. Now the nobility, both those who resided in the city to begin with and those who fled there, fear that [Root.GetName] is lost and have started to escape to those neighbors who may still house good [Root.Religion.GetName]s."
 tyw_events.28.a: "Let them flee, and return when [Root.GetName] sees better days."
 tyw_events.28.b: "Bring them to safety within our borders, whatever it takes."
 tyw_events.29.t: "[From.Culture.GetName] Nobles Seek Refuge"
 tyw_events.29.d: "The occupation of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has frightened many among [From.GetName]'s nobility, causing them to flee the country and hoping to find shelter among their fellow [Root.Religion.GetName]s here. Since the conflict is religious, at least on the surface, we would be expected to aid those who share our faith. Yet the eyes of the League's enemies are ever upon us, and there are many who would not take kindly to seeing their enemies under our protection."
 tyw_events.29.a: "Surely there are others who can carry this burden."
 tyw_events.29.b: "[Root.Religion.GetName] faithful will always find a haven here."
 tyw_events.30.t: "Íñigo Vélez de Guevara"
 tyw_events.30.d: "Conflicts like our present concerns over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire, although they may seem decided by war, also require diplomatic tact and shrewdness to be won. We happen to have a man at our disposal, the Count of Oñate, who possesses these exact talents. Our enemies in the Empire have neighbors who may very well be interested in knowing that we'd rather see that land in other hands. Merely letting them know could spark a conflict to our advantage."
 tyw_events.30.a: "Send news that [Root.GetName] wish to give them the lands of our enemies."
 tyw_events.30.a.tt: "Offer [This.GetName] a claim on a neighboring HRE nation who opposes on in the Leagues."
 tyw_events.30.b: "His talents are better applied to long-term diplomatic efforts."
 tyw_events.31.t: "[From.GetName] Offers League Enemy"
 tyw_events.31.d: "The allegiance of one of our neighbors, a fellow member of the Empire, appears to have angered [From.GetName]. They have sent an ambassador, a man named Íñigo Vélez de Guevara who appears to have conducted diplomacy in various parts of the Empire, to offer us a claim on the lands of those who have opposed their League.\n\nDire times may be ahead, but dire times are not without opportunities. This is a chance to expand our borders, or alternately to show that we mean our neighbors in the Empire no harm, regardless of League loyalties."
 tyw_events.31.a: "Accept the ambassador's offer."
 tyw_events.31.b: "Let all know that we do not lay claim to this land."
 tyw_events.32.t: "Enforce Sound Toll for Sweden"
 tyw_events.32.d: "The Sound Toll has been an important source of income for Denmark since the early 15th century and has allowed us to wield significant influence over the trade through Øresund since.\n\nSweden has been exempt from the tolls since our countries were united in the Kalmar Union. However, Sweden is no longer under the rule of the Danish crown and has not been for a long time. Perhaps they should start paying the price as well - there is only so much generosity we can show for old time's sake, after all."
 tyw_events.32.a: "We should have removed that exemption long ago."

 tyw_events.33.d: "Despite their control of the Sound already giving them a powerful position in Baltic trade, the Danes appear to have let their greed get the better of them. We have been informed that the Sound Toll, which our nation has been exempt from since the days of the Kalmar Union, is now enforced for Swedish ships as well. This is already looking to be a significant annoyance, and some advisors are even suggesting plans for going to war over this grave insult."
 tyw_events.33.a: "Danish devils!"
 tyw_events.34.t: "Request Ottoman Backing to Claim Poland"
 tyw_events.34.d: "We live in a time of possibilities, and our nation has only begun to expand its borders. Born at the edge between the Christian and the Muslim world, with both the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire so close, we must use our connections wisely to persist. Having maintained good diplomatic relations with the Turks, we can leverage their support to prepare an invasion of the Polish lands and claim them for our own."
 tyw_events.34.a: "The time is right. This is our chance."
 tyw_events.34.a.tt: "If the Ottomans agree, we should have claims on neighboring Polish provinces after a week."

 tyw_events.35.t: "Transylvania Requests Backing to Claim Poland"
 tyw_events.35.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName] of Transylvania has sent word that they considering an invasion of Poland. Believing that we'd benefit from seeing their neighbors weakened, they want our implicit support for claiming this land."
 tyw_events.35.a: "An excellent initiative."
 tyw_events.35.b: "We see no point in such a campaign."
 tyw_events.36.t: "Free Hungary from Religious Oppression"
 tyw_events.36.d: "The formation of the Leagues in the Holy Roman Empire have made it clear that we live in a time when nations no longer sit idly by and allow people of their faith to suffer under godless rulers. Not far from our border, Hungarian [Root.Religion.GetName]s are in exactly that unacceptable situation. Our nation has strong bonds with Hungary in law and in spirit, and cannot let this continue. It is time for us to free them and reclaim the land, so that [Root.Religion.GetName] blood may never be spilled upon it again."
 tyw_events.36.a: "Transylvania stands with the Hungarians."
 tyw_events.37.t: "Golden Age of Transylvania"
 tyw_events.37.d: "Our nation is seeing perhaps its best era since it was born into its current form. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven to be a highly capable [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and investments are being made to make [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a cultured and impressive city. We hope to spread architecture and education throughout the nation over the coming decade, and pray that this age of peace and prosperity will last."
 tyw_events.37.a: "We will build a nation to last throughout the ages."
 tyw_events.38.t: "United in Prayer"
 tyw_events.38.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName], being a [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] of faith, has found an unusually personal way of creating trust and ensuring loyalty. When meeting another [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler in person, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will often ask them to pray together for their common goals. While perhaps forsaking some of the distance sometimes needed in diplomacy, it can create stronger bonds than any formal agreement. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has considered employing this method again on an upcoming visit to a foreign capital, although it is not certain if it will be successful."
 tyw_events.38.a: "Souls, not only minds, must unite for true trust to be formed."

 tyw_events.39.d: "Our ongoing war over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire is going well. The optimism from seeing our efforts to accomplish religious goals has taken on an especially spiritual form, with one of our minister declaring that God is Spanish, fighting for our nation these days. If things continue to go our way, even our enemies may have to admit that there is some truth to this."
 tyw_events.39.a: "What better ally could a soldier ever ask for?"
 tyw_events.40.t: "God Wants Peace"
 tyw_events.40.d: "Our ongoing war over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire is going poorly. Since religion is at the core of this conflict, many of those who once claimed that God was with us when we decided to join the League are now claiming that God is depriving us of the means of war and wants us to make peace. Although far from the only interpretation of current events, it has been echoed enough times to increase the doubts that the war can be won."
 tyw_events.40.a: "'Tis a poor faith that increases doubt."
 tyw_events.41.t: "Bartering Increases"
 tyw_events.41.d: "While the poor state of the [Root.GetAdjective] currency is becoming ever more troubling for us, the common people have started to look to other solutions. Many are growing wary of the use of money and avoid it whenever possible, reverting to old means of trade like the barter system. Perhaps their concerns are misplaced, but if we do not act swiftly, we may lose our grip on the economy and the country itself."
 tyw_events.41.a: "Let us just hope this works well for them until we get the problem under control."
 tyw_events.41.b: "Seek the advice of our best economists to stop this by any means."
 tyw_events.42.t: "Capturing the Spanish Treasure Fleet"
 tyw_events.42.d: "Our privateers have long been an annoyance to the Spanish fleets, but a daring plan hatched recently would make us more than just an annoyance. The Spanish Treasure Fleet is departing from the colonies, carrying a cargo of silver, gold and exotic goods worth more than their weight in either. Our privateers plan to intercept these ships in the early stages of their route. They assure us that the cargo can be captured with little risk, and is unlikely to fail unless someone betrays our plan to the Spanish."
 tyw_events.42.a: "Their treasures are better off in [Root.GetAdjective] hands."
 tyw_events.42.b: "We hardly wish to draw the wrath of the Spanish armada."
 tyw_events.43.t: "Spanish Treasure Fleet Captured!"
 tyw_events.43.d: "One by one, the ships of the Spanish Treasure Fleet were intercepted, many of them taken by surprise, some of them trapped, unprepared for us to make such a bold attack. Despite some ships receiving warning beforehand, the cargo from the captured ships will boost our economy for months, if not years. The privateers have returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as heroes. We are unlikely to ever see such a successful capture again."
 tyw_events.43.a: "Yet it was a joy to see it once."
 tyw_events.44.t: "Treasure Fleet Captured by the Dutch"
 tyw_events.44.d: "The Dutch privateers who have long plagued our efforts to get trade goods home from distant colonies recently made a direct attack on our Treasure Fleet just as it was leaving for the Spanish ports to bring silver and gold back to our homeland. Although some ships were prepared and managed to avoid the assault, the ones who did not cost us dearly. It has not yet been decided how or what the Dutch will pay for this, but they will certainly pay."
 tyw_events.44.a: "Gold, silver and blood would all be acceptable currencies."
 tyw_events.45.t: "An Educated [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tyw_events.45.d: "The education [Root.Monarch.GetName] had growing up during the regency has prepared [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to rule as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], just as we hoped. The advisors who provided it are proud of having left such a lasting legacy in the wisdom and motives of the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] who will rule [Root.GetName]."
 tyw_events.45.a: "They should be."
 tyw_events.46.t: "Victory at [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]!"
 tyw_events.46.d: "The League war has brought us all the way to the capital of one of our enemies. Striking at the heart of their nation, we were victorious, to their great shame. Among the many skilled soldiers involved, one in particular has been praised for contributing to the victory and has been promoted to the position of general after showing exceptional calm and quick thinking during the mayhem."
 tyw_events.46.a: "He may strike fear into the hearts of more nations yet."
 tyw_events.47.t: "Preparing our Defenses"
 tyw_events.47.d: "[Root.GetName] is under attack, but the enemy has so far not advanced very far into our lands. Our army strategists suggest that we fortify our defenses where they are needed the most. They are, however, turning to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for an opinion on exactly where that would be. It is certainly true that we cannot afford to lose control of our capital but it may still be best to fortify our borders first."
 tyw_events.47.a: "Focus on preparing the capital and its surrounding provinces."
 tyw_events.47.b: "Fortifications must start at points on our borders."
 tyw_events.48.t: "True Intentions"
 tyw_events.48.d: "While the League war was started for religious reasons, the religious allegiance of the Holy Roman Empire is not the only concern of the members. Some see the war as a chance to claim land from some of those on the opposing side, considering the religious goals of the leaders to be secondary, if not a pretense entirely.\n\nRecently, we have been confronted by ambassadors from the leader of our League, who implores us to make our real motives clear for the benefit of future peace negotiations."
 tyw_events.48.a: "We hope to finish this war with more land and make no secret of this."
 tyw_events.48.b: "[Root.GetName] fights for the cause of faith itself!"
 tyw_events.49.t: "[From.GetName] Claims to Fight for Land"
 tyw_events.49.d: "While the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith may be crucial for us, some members of the League are not so noble in their intentions. An ambassador recently returned from [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] with word from the [From.GetAdjective], who admitted that what they really hope to gain from this war is expansion of their borders. Unpleasant news, weakening the strength of our cooperation and position to negotiate peace."
 tyw_events.49.a: "At least they are honest in their selfishness."
 tyw_events.50.t: "[From.GetName] Claims to Fight for Faith"
 tyw_events.50.d: "Not all of the League joined our side to fight for the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause. Many have simply chosen our side because it is politically expedient. Word from [From.GetName], however, is that they truly care about our plight and see the League as a religious alliance first and foremost, and go into battle knowing that they are doing God's work by our side."
 tyw_events.50.a: "Let us hope they remain true to such a noble ideal."

While $MONARCH$ is an immensely popular $MONARCHTITLE$ a durable state should not be built on personal loyalties alone. The road forward must be to unify our people through a common religious identity different from that of our neighbors.\nWhile far from all of our subjects would identify as Shia currently there are many cases of Shiite customs, such as the honoring of the Imams, being practiced by the Muslims of Persia. By ensuring that our people all adhere to Twelver Shiism we can create a Persian identity which will stand the test of time."

Ever since the last remaining heir of the Rathore lineage has been wandering the deserts of Rajasthan biding his time and waiting for an opportunity to reclaim his patrimony.\nThat time seems to have finally come, at least in the mind of Jodha Rathore.

 flavor_jnp.4.d: "The site of Jaunpur on the northern bank of the Gomti river has been commanded by a fort long before the arrival of Islam in these lands. The Delhi sultans in their day further fortified the place using materials from many of the buildings of the defeated Rashtrakutas of Kannauj.\nWith the advent of our independent Sultanate in the late 14th century the fort was further strengthened and began to serve as a royal residence. Now that our state has grown into a power in its own right, however, it is high time that we take a new look at the state of the Jaunpur Qila."

 flavor_jnp.5.d: "The first of the great works of the Jaunpur sultanate after its independence was the imposing Atala Masjid mosque, a marriage of local and Muslim architecture unlike anything that can be seen elsewhere in India. The impressive facade of the mosque is quite unique and has attracted the attention of both high and low.\nAs our Sultanate has grown so has the fame of the Atala Masjid mosque and as we now stand ready to start more works of construction it is believed we should continue to develop this unique architectural style and make it more closely associated with our Sultanate."

 flavor_jnp.6.t: "The Varanasi Pilgrims"
 flavor_jnp.6.d: "One of the oldest cities in the world and the holiest city of Hinduism, Varanasi, lies not far from Jaunpur. Every day countless Indian pilgrims traverse our lands to reach not only Varanasi but many of the other holy places of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism in the region we occupy.\nThese travelers are compelled by their religious convictions to make this journey and will attempt to reach their goal almost regardless of any hindrance we might put in their way. Our vizier has therefore suggested that we, like the Delhi sultans before us, create a specific tax on all pilgrims that would visit the holy places in our lands. In place such a tax would undoubtedly bring us a steady income, but it would not be a very popular policy among our non-Muslim subjects."

The Sadak-e-Azam is the commercial artery of Northern India and the means by which most goods and merchants arrive or leave our lands. Making the journey safer and quicker for the travelers of this road should be a top priority for our Sultanate and for any other power that the path crosses. It has been suggested that by enforcing the existing road and supplementing the existing stops of the route by a network of Serais of our own we might greatly ease the journey for many."

This is an area that for years has been contested between us and the Sultans of Malwa before finally falling into their hands in 1433.\nRumors of the bad conduct of the Malwan governor against the Muslim girls of his court have lately enflamed public opinion against him among our Muslim population.

The Jaunpuris would take the matter into their own hands and want to conduct a punitive expedition against Kalpi.\nWhile we have also heard rumors of the state of affairs in Kalpi this is a decision to consider carefully, Kalpi is an old contested zone between Jaunpur and Malwa and it does not seem unlikely that the Jaunpuris might have bigger plans than they let on."

 flavor_mlc.1.d: "The religious balance in an as cosmopolitan state as Malacca can be a very fragile thing. In our state traders of many religions and cultures live side by side yet still keep apart to a certain extent. The biggest communities, those of the Gujaratis, Tamils, Javanese and Chinese all have their own respective obligations to the state and keeping the influence of these groups in balance is one of the most important tasks of any Malaccan monarch.\nThe ascension of Raja Ibrahim in 1444 has therefore ruffled quite a few feathers. Ibrahim was a practicing Hindu and came to be seen by many as a traditionalist aiming to roll back the influence of Islam in our country. It still came as a big surprise when the young king was found dead in his palace today. Many suspect that his prime minister, the royal Bendahara, must've had a hand in this but little can be proven."

Nonetheless a royal Bendahara that would plot against his liege is a frightening thing and we would be wise to replace this minister or risk meeting the same fate as his last master.

 flavor_mlc.4.d: "Malacca has in many ways been the center of the islamization of the Malay archipelago. Our state itself has, however, always avoided any stern or overly orthodox varieties of Islamic law in favor of keeping it an attractive spot for traders of all nationalities. Instead tradition is relied upon to be the law of the land while orthodox Islamic laws have been reserved for special cases, often related to keeping the public order. While this has upset some of those with more delicate religious sensibilities over the years it has been good for trade and has therefore been supported the Malaccan communities.\nOver time, however, Muslims have become more and more dominant in our state and due to its importance for the spread of Islam among the islands some have even begun to consider Malacca a pilgrimage site. Perhaps the time has come to introduce a bit more orthodoxy in the laws and customs of our state?"

Despite this our kingdom is flourishing and ships from all over Asia come to our docks to sell, buy and resell all kinds of goods.\nIn order to further encourage trade the royal Bendahara has suggested that we lower customs and duties to almost nothing. This bold policy would set us apart even from other trade oriented kingdoms and would in his opinion secure our place as the greatest emporium of the East."

The captain presents himself as coming from a Christian kingdom far to the west known as Portugal and wants to sign a trade agreement by which his country would become one of the most favored trading partners of our state.\nThe Muslim Gujarati community, however, is propagating very strongly that the man is dangerous and that his country is a sworn enemy to our religion. The Gujaratis are so vehemently opposed to Portuguese presence here that they have already begun to act with open hostility towards the newcomers, confiscating their goods and boarding their ships. There is a risk that this could get out of hand very quickly..."

 flavor_ori.1.d: "The ceremonies at the great temple in Puri and the log in which Jagannath manifests himself have at times been ridiculed and mocked by foreign rulers, but in Orissa Jagannath, the 'Lord of the Universe' is undisputedly the most popular deity.\nThe support of Jagannath and his priests have also been unwavering for Raja Kapilendra, the founder of our dynasty. Now the time has come for our dynasty to repay this debt, we should patronize the temple at Puri and elevate the worship of Jagannath as the primary cult in our kingdom."

 flavor_ori.2.t: "The Wars of Kapilendra."
 flavor_ori.2.d: "When Kapilendra Deva overthrew the last of the Eastern Ganga Kings in 1434 Orissa was in a sad state. Muslim incursions from the north and west as well as rivalry with other neighbors to the south had reduced the kingdom greatly. Since then Raja Kapilendra has quickly turned all of that around. In consecutive wars with Bengal, the Reddys of Andhra, the Bahmani Sultans and the Vijayanagar empire, Orissa has grown in both size and strength under his leadership.\nThis constant warfare has, however, taken its toll on the population of our kingdom and an unusually bad harvest season has now resulted in growing popular unrest. It has been suggested that the public mood would be improved if we temporarily lifted the traditional Salt tax and otherwise devoted our attention to the public good a bit more."

To the shock of his 18 legitimate sons, however, the old king, guided by the voice of Jagannath, has elected to make his illegitimate son Purushottama his heir.\nAs the king draws his last breath the royal succession is far from assured as Hamvira, the favorite candidate until this date, has fled to the south where he has taken up arms against Purushottama."

 flavor_ori.5.b: "Avoid getting involved."

 flavor_ori.6.d: "The Bahmani sultan, an old enemy of our kingdom, has decided to back Hamvira. We can't know for sure what he has been promised but if rumors are to be believed Hamvira has been desperate enough to promise the Bahmanis a large part of our country."
 flavor_ori.6.a: "Best make sure he doesn't win then."

 flavor_zan.1.t: "Shirazi Islam and the Patricians of Kilwa"
 flavor_zan.1.d: "Most of the Swahili states are to this day ruled by dynasties that claim to be descended from the first Islamic migration into this region. The Islam practiced by these 'Shirazis', as they call themselves, is, however, not the most orthodox form of the religion. Many older local ceremonies are performed daily in our court and the Shirazi lineages are considered to have magical abilities that give them the right to rule these cities.\nAs the wealth of Kilwa and the other Swahili states grows, however, new waves of foreigners continue to arrive in great numbers. Traders from Oman, Persia, the Bahmani kingdom and other faraway lands have made our cities their home and a rising class of indigenous merchants has made these groups their partners. Many of the newcomers are abhorred by our traditions. If we would adopt a more orthodox form of Islam this would certainly help our relations with the other states of the Indian Ocean, but there is a very real risk that it would undermine our own rule and hurt relations with the other Swahili states."

 flavor_zan.2.t: "The Kilwa Chronicle"
 flavor_zan.2.d: "With more and more foreign traders arriving in the Swahili coast from orthodox Islamic states our old Shirazi ways have come more and more under fire. We have watched with disgust as some of the old Shirazi dynasties of the Swahili coast have been overthrown by a rising class of indigenous traders allied with the newcomers.\nAs one of the oldest and most powerful Shirazi dynasties, however, we still stand strong. In order to suitably impress foreigners and domestic troublemakers alike it might be best if we assigned our scribes to create a chronicle over our famous lineage, so that none may doubt our Shirazi origin and the old Islamic roots of our dynasty."
 flavor_zan.2.a: "Let us create such a Chronicle."

 flavor_zan.3.t: "Abandoning Shirazi traditions"
 flavor_zan.3.d: "In the process of reforming the religious establishment of our kingdom we have come to the point where we will need to make a choice in regards to which tradition we should try to emulate. Our kingdom is home to Persian Shiites, Ibadi traders from Oman as well as Indian and Turkish Sunni traders. Apart from theological considerations the form of Islam we will associate with is likely to shape the foreign policy of our kingdom for years to come."

 flavor_zan.4.d: "While our kingdom owes its entire existence to the Indian-Ocean trade network and holds very little real control over the African inland we must always be on our guard for the people of the interior. One such group, the cannibalistic Zimba, have been spreading fear along the coast far to our south. With little warning the Zimba suddenly descended on the city of Kilwa itself today. Many Kilwan citizens are now dead and even more have fled the city. It will take years for Kilwa to recover, we can scarcely remember a greater tragedy in the history of our kingdom."

Said's plot was, however, thwarted by the royal vizier Suleiman and the emir Muhammad al-Mazlum.\nWith the passing of Ismâ'îl himself, however, it seems Suleiman and Muhammad have decided that the time has come for them to rule in their own name. Acting quickly they have used their influence to secure the capital for themselves and have agreed to share power by taking the throne in turns."
